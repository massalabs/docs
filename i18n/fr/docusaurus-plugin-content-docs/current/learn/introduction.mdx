# What is Massa?

Massa is a public blockchain built to be scalable, efficient and secure. Massa uses a novel [Proof-of-Stake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_stake) consensus mechanism that massively increases throughput by [parallelizing block creation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09029), allowing up to 10'000 transactions per second. 

Massa provides the following key innovations:
1. **Autonomous Smart Contracts**: Massa's smart contracts can be programmed to execute autonomously, without the need for any external triggers or oracles.
2. **Decentralized Web**: decentralized applications can be hosted entirely on the Massa blockchain, reducing the exposure of dApps to centralized services.
3. **Developer Friendly**: Massa's smart contracts are written in TypeScript, a popular programming language that is familiar to many developers.
