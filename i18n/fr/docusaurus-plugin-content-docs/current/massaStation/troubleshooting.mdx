## Massa Station

### Massa Station isn't starting

To check what is happening, you can open Massa Station logs. See [Get Massa Station logs](#get-massa-station-logs) to know how to get them.

Once you have the logs, please go at the end of the file and look for the last error. If you see an error like this:

```
listen tcp :80: bind: address already in use
```

That means that another application is already using the port 80. You can either stop the application using the port 80 or change its port.

### I get a page with the error "DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN"

This error means that your computer can't resolve the domain name of Massa Station. This can happen in multiple cases:

#### The DNS server isn't installed

For Windows users, if you unselected the option to install the DNS server during the installation of Massa Station, `.massa` domain names can't be resolved.

To fix this, you can either reinstall Massa Station and make sure to select the option to install the DNS server
or you can manually change your DNS server to redirect the Massa Station domain name to your computer as explained in
the [manual installation](/docs/massaStation/manual-install#handle-massa-redirection) section.

If the problem persists, please go to the [Web browser is using another DNS server](#your-web-browser-is-using-another-dns-server) section.

#### The DNS server isn't running

If the DNS server is installed but not running, `.massa` domain names can't be resolved.
Please restart your computer to make sure that the DNS server is running.

If the problem persists, please go to the next section.

#### Your web browser is using another DNS server

If the DNS server is installed and running, the problem might be that your web browser is using another DNS server.
In Chromium based browsers, you can go to your browser settings and search for "Use secure DNS" and disable it.

If the problem persists, please open an issue with the logs of Massa Station as explained in the
[Get Massa Station logs](#get-massa-station-logs) section.

### I get a page with the error "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

This error means that your computer can't connect to Massa Station.
This might be because Massa Station isn't running or because the redirection to `station.massa` isn't working.

Please check that Massa Station is running and retry to open https://station.massa/ in your web browser.

If you still have the error, please open http://localhost/ in your web browser.
If you get the same error, that means that Massa Station isn't running. In that case, please follow the instructions provided in the [Massa Station isn't starting](#massa-station-isnt-starting) section.

![Wallet plugin error](wallet-plugin-error.png)

So far, this issue happens only on Linux because some dependencies aren't installed correctly.

#### Linux

1. Open your terminal
2. Verify witch version of this packet you have `libwebkit2gtk` with `apt list --installed libwebkit2gtk`
3. The required version is `0.4-37`, so you need to install it with this cmd `sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-37`. If the version installed is already the `0.4-37`, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/massalabs/station/issues/new/choose).
4. Once the library installed, restart Massa Wallet module by turning it off and on again.
