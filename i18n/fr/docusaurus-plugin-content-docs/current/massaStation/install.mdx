## Windows

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the installation.
3. You will be prompted to choose the kind of installation you want. We recommend choosing the "Complete" installation as it will install all the necessary dependencies to access web on-chain. If you select the "Typical" option, Massa Station will be installed without DNS configuration. In that case, access to `.massa` domains may be restricted.
4. Once the installation is complete, you can launch _Massa Station_ from the Start menu.
5. If prompted, click on "Yes" to allow the installer to make changes on certificates. These certificates allow _Massa Station_ to use the HTTPS protocol, which improves your security when [browsing dApp](browse-decentralized-application).
