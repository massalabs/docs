For your peace of mind, we recommend backing up your account. This ensures you can easily restore it if needed.
:::

The backup file contains your account private key encrypted with a password. You can restore your account by importing it using the backup file and the password.

1. Open the  *Massa Wallet* module.
2. Access your wallet.
3. Click on the **Settings** button in the left bar.

4. Click on **Back up Account**.
5. Choose how you want to backup your account:
   - Using a ‘.yaml’ file: Click on **Download .yaml file** and select a location to save the file.
   - Using the secret key: Click on **Show key pair**, type your password and copy the secret key by clicking on the **Copy Secret Key** button.
6. Save the file or the secret key in a safe place and do not share it with anyone.

:::tip
As a best practice, consider importing your account on another device to verify that your backup is fully functional.
