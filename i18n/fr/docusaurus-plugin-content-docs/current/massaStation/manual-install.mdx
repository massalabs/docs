## Installation

If you are unable to install _Massa Station_ using the methods described in the [Installation](/docs/massaStation/install) section,
or simply prefer to install it manually, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of the _Massa Station_ binary for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/massalabs/station/releases/latest).
   :::caution
   Make sure to download the binary for your operating system and architecture.<br/>
   For example, if you are using Windows 10 on a 64-bit machine, you should download the `massastation_windows_amd64` file.<br/>
   On Apple Silicon (M1, M2...) Macs, you should download the `massastation_darwin_arm64` file, while Intel Macs should download the `massastation_darwin_amd64` file.
   :::
2. Put the downloaded binary in a directory of your choice.
3. On MacOS and Linux:<br/>
   3.1. create the _Massa Station_ data directory:
   ```sh
   mkdir -m 777 -p /usr/local/share/massastation
   ```
   3.2. Add executable permissions to the binary:
   ```sh
   chmod +x massastation_$OS_$ARCH
   ```
   3.3. Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:
   ```sh
   mv massastation_$OS_$ARCH /usr/local/bin/massastation
   ```
4. Run the binary to start _Massa Station_.
5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/` to access _Massa Station_.

This method of installation will not install the necessary dependencies for _Massa Station_ to function correctly and so,
features such as HTTPS support and accessing `.massa` domains will not work.

### Handle `station.massa` redirection

If you want to access _Massa Station_ by typing `station.massa` in your browser's address bar, you will need to configure your system to redirect
requests to `station.massa` to `localhost`.
You can make this change by editing the 'hosts' file on your computer, regardless of whether you're using Windows, MacOS, or Linux:

1. Open the 'hosts' file, which is located at:
   - **Windows**: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
   - **MacOS** and **Linux**: `/etc/hosts`
2. Add `127.0.0.1 station.massa` at the end of the file.
3. Save and close the file.

### Add HTTPS support

Massa Station will automatically generate a self-signed certificate for HTTPS support when it is first run, but to do it,
it requires some dependencies to be installed on your system.

#### Windows

1. Download a Windows version of the Mar Tools
2. Extract the contents of the archive to a directory named `mar-tools` in the same directory as the `massastation.exe` binary.
3. Run the `massastation.exe` binary to start _Massa Station_.

#### MacOS

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Install the `nss` package using Homebrew: `brew install nss`
3. Create the certificate directory:
   ```sh
   mkdir -m 777 -p /etc/massastation/certs
   ```
4. Run the `massastation` binary in repair mode with `sudo`:
   ```sh
   sudo ./massastation --repair
   ```
5. Run the `massastation` binary to start _Massa Station_.

#### Linux

1. Install the `nss` package using your package manager.
2. Create the certificate directory:
   ```sh
   mkdir -m 777 -p /etc/massastation/certs
   ```
3. Run the `massastation` binary to start _Massa Station_.
