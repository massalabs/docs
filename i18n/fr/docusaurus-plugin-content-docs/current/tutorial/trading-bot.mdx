# Autonomous Trading Bot

This video is a great example of how to use Massa's [autonomous smart contracts](/docs/learn/asc/intro) to build a trading bot that will automatically buy and sell tokens on the [Dusa](https://dusa.io) decentralized exchange (DEX).

This tutorial covers all the tooling required to build a decentralized application on the Massa blockchain, from the smart contract to the front-end interface, making it a great way to get started with Massa.
