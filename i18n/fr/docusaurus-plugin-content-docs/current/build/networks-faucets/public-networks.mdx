## What's a Network, Anyway?

In the realm of blockchain technology, a network is a decentralized system of interconnected nodes.
These nodes work in harmony to ensure the blockchain runs smoothly, validating transactions, adding them to the blockchain, and maintaining the integrity of the ledger.

## What about Faucets?

A faucet, in the context of blockchain, is a mechanism that provides small amounts of cryptocurrency to users for free.
Think of it as a digital tap that drips a small portion of a specific cryptocurrency.

Faucets play a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem:

- they offer a friendly introduction to new users by giving them a starting amount of cryptocurrency, and
- they also aid developers in testing and building blockchain applications by providing the necessary tokens for experimentation.

## What's Special About These Networks?

### Mainnet

The Massa Mainnet is the main network. It is the only Massa network for which MAS has a monetary value. As a result, no faucet is available for the Mainnet.

### Buildnet

The Massa Buildnet serves as your reliable playground for crafting and deploying smart contracts on the Massa blockchain. Buildnet follows a gradual upgrade cycle. This careful pace ensures its constant availability and stability - key factors that you, as a developer, rely on.

At MassaLabs, we put significant effort into the careful maintenance of Buildnet. Our goal is to provide you with a platform where you can build robust, innovative applications.

Leveraging Buildnet's unique features and capabilities, you can navigate the forefront of blockchain technology with confidence and peace of mind, knowing you have a stable and dependable environment for your projects.

## Are There Any Requirements for Using Faucets?

Sure! You'll need:

- A Massa wallet (Don't have one yet? Generate addresses on the [Explorer website](https://massa.net/testnet/wallet))
- A [Discord account](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started)
