If you need to interact with the Massa network for your backend, you can use the Massa Web3 API without the wallet provider.
Initialization of the client is shown in the [introduction](/docs/build/massa-web3#without-wallet-provider)
of the Massa Web3.

## Wallet & Account Management

The Wallet API provides a range of methods for creating or importing an account, getting account information, sending transactions, signing
messages, etc.

A [complete example](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3/blob/main/examples/wallet/index.ts) of how to use the Wallet
API is also available.

You can also find the full typescript documentation [here](https://web3.docs.massa.net/classes/WalletClient.html).

## Private and Public API

All the operations needed to manage a node are available through the private API. The corresponding Typescript documentation can be found [here](https://web3.docs.massa.net/classes/PrivateApiClient.html).

Reading the state of the blockchain can be done through the public API. The corresponding Typescript documentation can be found
[here](https://web3.docs.massa.net/classes/PublicApiClient.html).
