# Creating a Massa wallet

In this tutorial you will learn how to create or import a Massa wallet.

A wallet is a file that contains a list of keypairs. Like other blockchains, Massa uses elliptic curve cryptography
(specifically ed25519) to secure your coins. It means that your secret key is your password allowing you to spend coins
that were sent to your address.

## From the command line interface

### If your client is not running

Go to the client folder:

```shell
cd massa/massa-client/
```

Start the interactive client and load a wallet file:

```shell
cargo run
```

It will ask your wallet password in order to load the `wallet.dat` file. If the file does not exist, you will be asked
to set a password and it will be created.

### If your client is running

Now you can either generate a new keypair (and associated address):

```shell
wallet_generate_secret_key
```

The list of addresses of your wallet can be accessed with:

```shell
wallet_info
```

Access public key(s) of addresse(s):

```shell
wallet_get_public_key <Address1> <Address2>
```

Access secret key(s) of addresse(s):

```shell
wallet_get_secret_key <Address1> <Address2>
```

# Importing your wallet in the client

In order to import a wallet into your client, the procedure depends on how you have saved your wallet in the first place.

## If you have saved your secret/private key

Then you can import it in the client using the following command:
```shell
wallet_add_secret_keys <your_secret_key>
```

## If you have saved an encrypted wallet file

Then you can import it in the client by placing the corresponding `.yaml` file in the `massa/massa-client/wallets` folder.
Make sure it is the only wallet in the folder.

## What next ?

Congratulations, you are now running a node and have access to a wallet.
But your node is still not staking, so it is not producing blocks nor receiving rewards.

It is time to activate staking on your node. Follow the tutorial: [Staking with a node](/docs/node/stake).
