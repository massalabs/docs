# Check your node's status

## Check your routability status

You can use a service such as https://portchecker.co to check that the ports 31244 and 31245 are both opened for your public IP address.

Additionally, in your massa-client, you can check that the `get_status` command shows your `Node's IP: <your_public_ip_address>`.
If it shows `No routable IP set` instead, please check again your configuration.

## Make sure you are connected to peers

In order for your node to be running properly, you have to make sure you are connected to other peers on the network.

The `get_status` command will show you which nodes you are connected too.
You need to have both IN and OUT connections.
