# Introduction

[Massa Bridge](https://bridge.massa.net/) is the first cross-chain bridge that allows you to transfer ERC-20 tokens from EVM-based networks to Massa, and vice versa.

It comes with two modes:

1. **Mainnet:** enabling bridging from Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain (BSC) to Massa.
2. **Testnet:** enabling bridging from Sepolia Testnet or BSC Testnet to Massa Buildnet.

Massa Bridge currently enables bridging Circle USD, DAI, and Wrapped Ether from Ethereum, and Bridged USDT and Ethereum Token from Binance Smart Chain.
Synthetic assets received on Massa blockchain contain a suffix in the token name to identify the origin chain. For example, USDC bridged from Ethereum will become USDC.e on Massa. USDT from BSC chain becomes USDT.b on Massa.

### Bridge fees

Depending on the EVM network and the direction of the bridge operation, the system can charge a fee. As of today, all transfers from EVM networks to Massa are free of charge. Redeems on the Binance Smart chain are also free. However a 0.1% fee will be applied when transferring assets from Massa to the Ethereum network. The fee is charged at the smart contract level and is automatically deducted from the transferred amount.

| Bridge direction  | Bridge fee |
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Ethereum to Massa | 0%         |
| Massa to Ethereum | 0.1%       |
| BSC to Massa      | 0%         |
| Massa to BSC      | 0%         |
