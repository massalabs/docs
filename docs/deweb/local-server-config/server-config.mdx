# Server Configuration

To configure your DeWeb server, create a YAML configuration file named `deweb_server_config.yaml`
and store it alongside the server binary. Below is an example configuration file:

## Example Configuration

```yaml
domain: "massa.network"
network_node_url: "https://mainnet.massa.net/api/v2"
api_port: 8080
allow_list:
  - "massaNameService"
  - "AS1S...19b3"
block_list:
  - "massaNameService"
  - "AS1S...4x3o"
misc_public_info: {
  "tips": {
    "BTC": "1PMyg9yJe9Y8zS3bD2N4e6w2F7K6Rmyt7B",
    "ETH": "0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976F",
    "MAS": "AU1wfDH3BNBiFF9Nwko6g8q5gMzHW8KUHUL2YysxkZKNZHq37AfX"
  }
}
```

## Default Configuration

If no configuration file is provided, the server will use the following default settings:

```yaml
domain: "localhost"
network_node_url: "https://mainnet.massa.net/api/v2"
api_port: 8080
```

## Configuration Fields

- **Domain**: The domain the website is running on.
  For example, set this to `massa.network` if your server is running on `massa.network`.
  The default value is `localhost`.

- **NetworkNodeURL**: The node DeWeb server will connect to. By default, this is set to `https://mainnet.massa.net/api/v2`.
  You can use any node address for the JSON public API,
  such as those listed in the [Massa API Documentation](https://docs.massa.net/docs/build/api/jsonrpc) (Default port: 33035).

  :::tip
  To access a website that has been deployed on buildnet,
  set the node address to `https://buildnet.massa.net/api/v2`.
  :::

- **APIPort**: The port the server will run on. The default value is 8080.

- **AllowList**: A list of domains or smart contract addresses that are explicitly allowed.
  By default, this list is empty. If specified, only the websites in this list will be accessible.

- **BlockList**: A list of domains or smart contract addresses that are explicitly blocked.
  By default, this list is empty. Websites in this list will be inaccessible.

- **misc_public_info**:  Optional, arbitrary raw JSON returned as the `misc` section of JSON object returned by the `/__deweb_info` public endpoint of the provider. It is useful in particular for allowing front-ends to tip the provider to incentivize quality of service. The `tips` section should be a dictionary of uppercase currency symbols as keys and the corresponding addresses that you own as values.
