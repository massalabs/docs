# MNS Domain Name Immutability

Making an MNS domain name immutable is achieved by changing its owner to a blank address.

To do so, go on https://mns.massa.network and connect your wallet.
Then find the mns you want to make immutable and click on **change ownership** button.

Then click on the **Renounce ownership** toggle and click on save.

Once the operation has been finalized on chain, the mns become immutable.

:::warning

Once you lose ownership of an MNS, you will never be able to change its target, transfer it to someone else, or delete it to reclaim fee tokens.
