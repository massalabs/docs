# Welcome to the DeWeb

The DeWeb is your gateway to a fully decentralized web. Our vision is to create an on-chain web ecosystem with no intermediaries,
addressing security and reliability concerns associated with centralized servers.

## Our Vision

The DeWeb aims to revolutionize the internet by enabling a fully decentralized web experience. By storing all websites on-chain,
we eliminate the risks associated with centralized servers, such as single points of failure and vulnerability to hacks.
This approach enhances security, ensuring that websites are resilient against censorship and attacks,
and provides true freedom and accessibility to everyone.

The DeWeb allows developers to build and host their projects directly on the Massa blockchain.
This unique approach mitigates the risks of censorship and hacking, providing a seamless Web3 experience for users.
Developers can register ".massa" domains using MNS and store their websites' logic directly on the Massa blockchain,
ensuring applications are accessible directly from any browser of a user who installed DeWeb server app, without any intermediaries.

## Decentralized Web Hosting

The DeWeb enables developers to build and host both front-end and back-end components of DApps directly on the Massa blockchain.
This comprehensive on-chain hosting includes:

- **Domain Registration**: Register ".massa" domain names using the Massa Name Service (MNS) on the decentralized DNS,
  creating unique, recognizable web addresses.
- **Back-End Hosting**: Develop and host smart contracts in AssemblyScript,
  ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain infrastructure.
- **Front-End Hosting**: Design and host the application's front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
  and other familiar web technologies, eliminating the need for third-party hosting services.

This approach ensures a seamless transition between web2 and web3 experiences, providing users with a consistent and
secure browsing experience without intermediaries.

## Who is the Deweb for ?
It's perfect for entrepreneurs & web3 studios who want to migrate to a decentralized hosting solution. 

It's also great builders & developers blockchain enthusiasts who want to build fully on-chain, censorship-resistant, and tamper-proof applications. 

## Get Started

### Users: Access the DeWeb 

#### Local-first DeWeb access

For complete privacy and autonomy, we recommend running a DeWeb server locally.
Visit the [Getting Started](./getting-started/overview.mdx) page to begin.

You can access local websites through the following URL : ```{massaNameService}.localhost:8080```

:::warning Important

If you're not a developer or a visual learner check out [how to set up a local server in under 1 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJUf3fU1MDI)

:::

#### Provider access

To make the DeWeb universally accessible without running a local server, providers are available.

These providers allow users to access decentralized websites directly from their browsers,
making it easy to use the DeWeb from anywhere and on devices that do not yet support DeWeb.

Here is a list of available providers:

- **Mainnet**: Coming Soon...
- **Buildnet**: [massa.network](https://massa.network), [massahub.network](https://massahub.network)

:::important
This list will eventually be transferred to the registry.

We are working on a provider registry system so you can have quick access to different Massa DeWeb providers.

### Developers: Upload Your Website On the DeWeb

Developers can upload their websites to the Massa blockchain using the [DeWeb upload CLI](./upload/cli.mdx).


:::info Work in Progress
DeWeb is still in development and should be used with caution. For now it is only available on Massa Buildnet for testing purposes.
This means that your wallet needs to be setup to use the Buildnet, including the Buildnet version of Massa Name System which is independent from the Mainnet one.

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please let us know through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/issues).

## Examples of on-chain websites:

| **Network** | **Provider**            | **Provider URL**                                     | Local URL |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------| 
| **Buildnet**| vesting.massa.network   | [vesting.massa.network](http://vesting.massa.network)|vesting.localhost:8080
| **Buildnet**| mns.massa.network       | [mns.massa.network](http://mns.massa.network) | mns.localhost:8080
| **Buildnet**| pur.massahub.network    | [pur.massahub.network](http://pur.massahub.network) | pur.localhost:8080
