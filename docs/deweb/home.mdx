# Welcome to DeWeb

DeWeb is your gateway to a fully decentralized web. Our vision is to create an on-chain web ecosystem with no intermediaries,
addressing security and reliability concerns associated with centralized servers.

## Our Vision

DeWeb aims to revolutionize the internet by enabling a fully decentralized web experience. By storing all websites on-chain,
we eliminate the risks associated with centralized servers, such as single points of failure and vulnerability to hacks.
This approach enhances security, ensuring that websites are resilient against censorship and attacks,
and provides true freedom and accessibility to everyone.

DeWeb allows developers to build and host their projects directly on the Massa blockchain.
This unique approach mitigates the risks of censorship and hacking, providing a seamless Web3 experience for users.
Developers can register ".massa" domains using MNS and store their websites' logic directly on the Massa blockchain,
ensuring applications are accessible directly from any browser of a user who installed DeWeb, without any intermediaries.

## Decentralized Web Hosting

DeWeb enables developers to build and host both front-end and back-end components of DApps directly on the Massa blockchain.
This comprehensive on-chain hosting includes:

- **Domain Registration**: Register ".massa" domain names using the Massa Name Service (MNS) on the decentralized DNS,
  creating unique, recognizable web addresses.
- **Back-End Hosting**: Develop and host smart contracts in AssemblyScript,
  ensuring the integrity and security of the blockchain infrastructure.
- **Front-End Hosting**: Design and host the application's front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
  and other familiar web technologies, eliminating the need for third-party hosting services.

This approach ensures a seamless transition between web2 and web3 experiences, providing users with a consistent and
secure browsing experience without intermediaries.

## Public Instances

To make DeWeb universally accessible without running a local server, public instances are available.
These instances allow users to access decentralized websites directly from their browsers,
making it easy to use DeWeb from anywhere and on devices that do not yet support DeWeb.

Here is a list of available public instances:

- **Buildnet**: [massa.network](https://massa.network)
- **Mainnet**: Coming Soon...

This list will expand with registered public instances in the future.


## Get Started

For complete privacy and autonomy, we recommend running a DeWeb server locally.
Visit the [Getting Started](./getting-started/overview.mdx) page to begin.

:::info Work in Progress
DeWeb is still a work in progress, and we are actively listening to feedback.
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please let us know through our [issue tracker](https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/issues).
