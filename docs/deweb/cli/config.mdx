# CLI Configuration

The DeWeb CLI supports configuration via a JSON file, allowing users to manage essential settings like wallet credentials
and node details for seamless website deployment on the Massa blockchain.

## Config File Structure

Here’s a sample `deweb_cli_config.json` setup:

```json
{
  "wallet_password": "your-wallet-password",
  "wallet_path": "your-wallet.yaml",
  "node_url": "https://mainnet.massa.net/api/v2",
  "chunk_size": 64000
  "metadatas": {
    "TITLE": "My Website",
    "DESCRIPTION": "This is my website",
    "KEYWORD1": "deweb",
    "KEYWORD2": "massa",
  }
}
```

Here’s a breakdown of each field:

- **`node_url`**: The URL of the Massa node where your website will be uploaded.
- **`chunk_size`**: Defines the size in bytes of each chunk for file upload.
  The default is typically `64000`, but it can be adjusted based on your needs and network conditions.
- **`wallet_password`**: The password for your Massa wallet file, used when `wallet_path` is specified.
- **`wallet_path`**: The file path to your Massa wallet in YAML format. Only YAML wallet files are supported.
- **`secret_key`**: The secret key for your Massa account. Use this as an alternative to `wallet_password` and `wallet_path`.
- **`metadatas`**: An optional field that allows you to specify metadatas for your website.
  Those metadatas will be stored on the Massa blockchain and can be accessed by anyone.
  :::tip About Metadatas
    The following metadata keys will be used for website indexing and decentralized search:

    - `TITLE`: The title of your website (max length of 50 characters).
    - `DESCRIPTION`: A brief description of your website (max length of 250 characters).
    - `KEYWORD1`, `KEYWORD2`, `KEYWORD3`, `KEYWORD4`, `KEYWORD5`: Keywords that describe your website (max length of 50 characters each).

:::info Note on Wallet Credentials
If `wallet_path` + `wallet_password` **and** `secret_key` are used in the config file, `secret_key` will take precedence.

If the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable is set, it will take precedence over the `secret_key` and `wallet` fields in the config file.

## Setting Configurations Directly on the Command Line

If you prefer, you can bypass the config file and specify values directly on the command line. For example:

```bash
npx @massalabs/deweb-cli upload <website_path> --node_url <your_node_url> --wallet <path_to_wallet> --password <your_password>
```

You can also set the **secret key** as an environment variable:

```bash
export SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
```
