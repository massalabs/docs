# Uploading a Website

Follow these steps to upload a website to the Massa blockchain using the DeWeb CLI.
You can configure settings using either a config file or command-line options.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- **Massa Wallet**: A wallet file in YAML format or a secret key.
  Refer to [Massa wallet documentation](/docs/massaStation/massa-wallet/account-backup) for guidance on obtaining these.
- **Node URL**: The URL for the Massa node you plan to use.
- **Website Files**: Ensure your website files are in a directory on your local machine and
  meet the requirements outlined below.

### Website Requirements

DeWeb only supports websites that are pre-built. This means the files are generated in advance and
ready to serve directly from storage. Your website bundle must include:

- **An `index.html` file** at the root of the directory, which serves as the entry point for your website.
- Any supporting files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) within the same directory.

This format allows the website to be served directly from the blockchain without the need for server-side processing
but supports technologies like Client-Side Rendering (CSR), Client-Side Routing, Single Page Applications (SPAs),
and communication with external APIs.

#### Supported Technologies

Any tools, frameworks, or build systems that generate pre-built files as described above should work with DeWeb.
This includes projects that output an `index.html` file along with all necessary assets for client-side rendering.
Examples of supported technologies include:

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** applications built with tools like [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)**
- Projects built using build tools like **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**

These technologies produce client-side applications that are bundled into static files and can be served as-is.
They support client-side routing, API calls, and other interactive features, provided all necessary files are included in the build output.

#### Frameworks Requiring Configuration

Frameworks such as **Next.js**, **Nuxt.js**, or **SvelteKit** can be used with DeWeb **if they are explicitly configured to output fully static files**.
By default, these frameworks may rely on features like:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Pages are generated dynamically on the server at runtime.
- **Dynamic Content Generation:** Content depends on backend processing or API routes provided by the framework.

To make these frameworks compatible with DeWeb, you need to configure them to generate a static build.
Please consult your framework's documentation for detailed instructions on generating a static build compatible with DeWeb.

:::caution
While we aim to support a wide range of frameworks, compatibility may vary.
Please ensure your setup works as expected.
If you encounter any issues or need assistance, feel free to report them at [https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/issues](https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/issues).
A static bundle, as described, should work seamlessly with DeWeb.
:::

#### Unsupported Configurations

Websites or applications that require server-side rendering, depend on backend servers to generate pages,
or rely on dynamic content generation at runtime are **not supported** unless they can be configured to output static files as described above.

Examples of unsupported setups include:

- **Default configurations of Next.js, Nuxt.js, or SvelteKit** that use server-side rendering or dynamic routes.
- Applications that depend on server-side code or databases to serve content.
- Projects that cannot produce a self-contained bundle with an `index.html` file and all necessary assets.

:::info
We are continuously working to expand compatibility with a wider range of frameworks and setups.
Stay tuned for updates and improvements to DeWeb's capabilities.
:::

**Summary:**

- **Supported:** Any client-side applications that build to a static bundle containing an `index.html` and assets. This includes SPAs with client-side routing and API calls, as long as all necessary files are included in the build output.
- **Conditionally Supported:** Frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt.js, and SvelteKit, **if** they are configured to output static files (no SSR or dynamic server-side features).

- **Unsupported:** Applications requiring server-side rendering, dynamic server-side features, or backend processing at runtime.

## Step 1: Configure Access

You have two ways to configure access for `deweb-cli`: by using a configuration file or by providing options directly on the command line.

### Option A: Using a Config File

For persistent settings, create a config file as described in the [CLI Configuration](./config) page. This file can store values for `node_url`, `wallet_path`, `wallet_password`, `chunk_size`, or `secret_key`.

### Option B: Using Command-Line Options

Alternatively, specify configurations directly in the command line for a one-time setup.

- Use the following command to upload a website with command-line options:

  ```bash
  npx @massalabs/deweb-cli upload <website_path> --node_url <your_node_url> --wallet <path_to_wallet> --password <your_password>
  ```

- **Using a Secret Key**: If you prefer to use a secret key instead of a wallet file, set it as an environment variable:

  ```bash
  export SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
  ```

  `deweb-cli` will detect the `SECRET_KEY` variable automatically.

## Step 2: Add Metadata

Add the following metadata to your config file to help index your website:

- `TITLE`: The title of your website (max length of 50 characters).
- `DESCRIPTION`: A brief description of your website (max length of 250 characters).
- `KEYWORD1`, `KEYWORD2`, `KEYWORD3`, `KEYWORD4`, `KEYWORD5`: Keywords that describe your website (max length of 50 characters each).

For more information on the metadata fields and CLI config file, refer to the [CLI Configuration](./config) page.

## Step 3: Run the Upload Command

With your configuration in place, run the `upload` command to deploy your website:

```bash
npx @massalabs/deweb-cli upload /path/to/website-build-directory
```

:::note
If you need to edit an existing website,
you can simply use the `--address` flag to specify the smart contract address of the website you want to edit.
:::

This command will begin the upload process.

## Step 4: Confirm the Upload

While the command is running, you will see estimated costs and be prompted to confirm the upload. Select `yes` to proceed.

## Step 5: Follow the Progress

The CLI will display the progress of the upload, including the number of chunks uploaded.

Once your website has been successfully uploaded, you will see a success message with the address where your website is hosted:

```bash
Website deployed at AS12v...2UgLS
```

This message confirms that your website has been successfully deployed on the Massa blockchain.
The output address (`AS12v...2UgLS` in this example) represents the address where your website is hosted.

## Step 6: Access Your Website

To be able to access your website, you need to associate it with a Massa domain. Follow the instructions in [Assigning a MNS to your website](../upload/mns) to link your deployed website address to a custom Massa domain.
