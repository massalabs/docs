# Setting up a Local Server

Setting up a DeWeb server locally allows you to browse and manage decentralized websites without any intermediaries.
Follow these steps to get started.

## Step 1: Download the Binary

1. Visit the [DeWeb Releases](https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/releases/latest) page on GitHub.
2. Download the binary file matching your operating system and architecture:

   - **Linux**: `deweb-server-linux-{arch}`
   - **Windows**: `deweb-server-windows-{arch}`
   - **MacOS (Darwin)**: `deweb-server-darwin-{arch}` (For Apple Silicon, choose `arm64`)

   If your target or architecture is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/issues)
   to request it.

## Step 2: Extract the Binary

1. Extract the downloaded file if it is in a zip format.

## Step 3: Run the Server

### Option 1: Using GUI

#### Windows

1. Navigate to the directory where the binary is located.
2. Double-click the `deweb-server.exe` file.

#### MacOS

1. Navigate to the directory where the binary is located.
2. Right-click the `deweb-server` file and select "Open".
3. A warning dialog will appear. Click "Open" to run the binary.
4. After the first run, you can double-click the binary to open it.

#### Linux

For Linux users, running binaries via GUI can vary greatly depending on the desktop environment. Generally:

1. Navigate to the directory where the binary is located.
2. Right-click the binary and select "Properties".
3. Ensure the "Execute" permission is checked.
4. Double-click the binary to run it.

### Option 2: Using Terminal

1. Open your terminal (command prompt on Windows).
2. Navigate to the directory where the binary is located.

3. Run the server with the following command:

```bash
./deweb-server
```

:::info
On macOS or Linux run `chmod +x deweb-server` command before `./deweb-server` to allow execution.

On Windows, use `deweb-server.exe` instead of `./deweb-server`
:::

## Step 4: Access the Server

By default, the DeWeb server runs on `localhost:8080`. You can access it using a web browser:

- Visit `http://deweb.localhost:8080` to see the welcome page.

## Configuration

To customize your server settings, refer to the [Server Configuration](../configuration/server-config) page.

:::info Work in Progress
DeWeb is still a work in progress, and we are actively listening to feedback.
