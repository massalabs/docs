# Setting up a Public Instance

Setting up a public DeWeb instance allows you to provide access to decentralized websites through your own domain.
Follow these steps to get started.

:::caution Important Notice
Depending on your country and  jurisdiction, serving on-chain content publicly might have legal implications. We strongly recommend you getting to know your local regulations to ensure proper compliance.

Providers operate independently and can set their own content policies.
Each provider can use the blocklist/whitelist system to comply with local regulations by selecting the websites they wish or not to serve.
:::

## Step 1: Download the Binary

1. Visit the [DeWeb Releases](https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/releases/latest) page on GitHub.
2. Download the binary file matching your operating system and architecture:

   - **Linux**: `deweb-server-linux-{arch}`
   - **Windows**: `deweb-server-windows-{arch}`
   - **MacOS (Darwin)**: `deweb-server-darwin-{arch}` (For Apple Silicon, choose `arm64`)

   If your target or architecture is missing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/issues)
   to request it.

## Step 2: Extract the Binary

1. Extract the downloaded file if it is in a zip format.

## Step 3: Configure the Server

1. Create a configuration file named `deweb_server_config.yaml` in the same directory as the server binary.
2. At a minimum, set the `domain` field in the configuration file. For example, if you own the domain `example.com`
   and will make your DeWeb instance available on it, set the `domain` to `example.com`.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
domain: "example.com"
network_node_url: "https://buildnet.massa.net/api/v2"
api_port: 8080
allow_list:
  - "allowed-domain"
  - "AS1Seo2..."
block_list:
  - "blocked-domain"
  - "AS1REo4..."
```

The allow/block lists allow you to control which websites are accessible through your instance.
You can use MNS domain names or smart contract addresses in these lists.

For more detailed settings and options, refer to the [Server Configuration](../configuration/server-config) page.

## Step 4: DNS Configuration

To serve DeWeb properly, you need to configure your DNS provider to handle subdomains for MNS domains.
In your domain provider panel, set the following DNS records:

- **A Record** for IPv4: `*.example.com` pointing to your server's IPv4 address.
- **AAAA Record** for IPv6: `*.example.com` pointing to your server's IPv6 address.

## Step 5: Set Up HTTPS and Web Server

DeWeb requires HTTPS to be properly served. You will need an HTTPS certificate for `*.example.com`
and a web server (like Nginx, Apache, etc.) to handle the HTTPS and proxy the requests to your DeWeb server.

### General Steps:

1. **Obtain an HTTPS Certificate**: Get an SSL certificate for `*.example.com`.
   You can use services like Let's Encrypt to get a free certificate.
2. **Configure Your Web Server**: Set up your web server to:
   - Listen on port 80 and redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
   - Listen on port 443 for HTTPS requests.
   - Proxy requests to your DeWeb server running on `localhost:8080`.

For specific configurations, refer to the documentation of the web server you are using (e.g., Nginx, Apache).

## Step 6: Copy the Files to the Server

Copy the extracted binary and the configuration file (`deweb_server_config.yaml`) to your server.
You can use tools like `scp` or any other method you prefer to transfer files to your server.

## Step 7: Run the Server

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where the binary and configuration file are located.
3. Run the server with the following command:

   ```bash
   ./deweb-server
   ```

   (On Windows, use `deweb-server.exe`instead of`./deweb-server`)

## Step 8: Access the Server

Your DeWeb instance will be accessible from the domain you configured. For example,
if you set the domain to `example.com`, you can access your DeWeb instance at `http://example.com`.
