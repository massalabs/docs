# DeWeb Registries

DeWeb uses registries to simplify the process of finding and accessing on-chain websites.
These registries serve as indexes for on-chain websites, making it easier for users to discover and interact with them.
Websites owners and Providers administrators can register their websites and providers in the respective registries.

:::info
These registries are intermediary solutions, intended to simplify operations and enhance usability while a fully decentralized,
on-chain alternative is being developed.

## Website Registry

The website registry plays a vital role in improving the accessibility of on-chain websites.
Since these sites are referenced by smart contract addresses, locating them directly can be impractical for end users.
The registry provides a temporary solution by offering an index of all on-chain websites, simplifying discovery and interaction.
In addition, it facilitates optimized search capabilities based on metadata, categories, or other relevant parameters.

Here is a list of websites that have been uploaded to the DeWeb:

### Register Your Website

You can register your website hosted on DeWeb by opening a pull request to the [DeWeb Websites Registry](https://github.com/massalabs/Deweb-Websites).
Your pull request must follow the guidelines outlined in the [repository's README file](https://github.com/massalabs/Deweb-Websites?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-a-website).

## Provider Registry

The provider registry enables the creation of customizable access points to on-chain content, helping individuals and
organizations securely distribute their data. Providers act as intermediaries, allowing end users to access on-chain content with ease,
without requiring direct interaction with smart contracts. This system also supports allow-list functionality,
empowering providers to limit access to specific on-chain content. For example, an organization like Solana could establish a provider
using the `.solana.com` domain and configure an allow-list to deliver only its on-chain applications.
