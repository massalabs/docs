# DeWeb Registries

DeWeb uses registries to simplify the process of finding and accessing on-chain websites.
These registries serve as indexes for on-chain websites, making it easier for users to discover and interact with them.
Websites owners and Providers administrators can register their websites and providers in the respective registries.

## Website Registry

The website registry plays a vital role in improving the accessibility of on-chain websites.
Since these sites are referenced by smart contract addresses, locating them directly can be impractical for end users.
The registry provides a temporary solution by offering an index of all on-chain websites, simplifying discovery and interaction.
In addition, it facilitates optimized search capabilities based on metadata, categories, or other relevant parameters.

### Register Your Website

Websites uploaded using the [DeWeb CLI](../cli/overview) or the [Decentralized Web Services platform](https://dws.massa.network)
are automatically registered in the DeWeb Website Index Smart Contract. This process ensures that your website is easily
discoverable by users.

#### Manual Registration

If you uploaded your website using a different method, you can manually register it by calling the `updateWebsite` function
of the DeWeb Website Index Smart Contract. This function only requires the website smart contract address serialized using
the [Args](../../build/smart-contract/basic-concepts/functions-parameters#using-args-for-serialization-and-deserialization) format.

Here are the Smart Contract addresses for the DeWeb Website Index:

| Network  | Address                                               |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Mainnet  | AS12UpEfdonZxyFnsmrJfZbXLM3Gq6LaL3hPk7wTXqU4UZfnypKzF |
| Buildnet | AS1TmA4GNpSYBseNNMXpbAp2trUwZxZy3T1sZ9Qd3Qdn9L8wGbMS  |

## Provider Registry

The provider registry enables the creation of customizable access points to on-chain content, helping individuals and
organizations securely distribute their data. Providers act as intermediaries, allowing end users to access on-chain content with ease,
without requiring direct interaction with smart contracts. This system also supports allow-list functionality,
empowering providers to limit access to specific on-chain content. For example, an organization like Solana could establish a provider
using the `.solana.com` domain and configure an allow-list to deliver only its on-chain applications.
