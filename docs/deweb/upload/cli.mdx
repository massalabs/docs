# DeWeb CLI

The DeWeb CLI is a command-line tool designed for deploying, editing, and deleting decentralized websites on the DeWeb platform.



## Downloading the CLI tool 

You can download the DeWeb CLI tool from the [DeWeb Releases Page](https://github.com/massalabs/DeWeb/releases). 

:::info
On macOS or Linux run `chmod +x deweb-cli_{targetOS}` command before `./deweb-cli_{targetOS}` to allow execution.

On Windows, use `deweb-cli_{targetOS}.exe` instead of `./deweb-cli_{targetOS}`
:::

## Usage

You can use the `deweb-cli` command to interact with the DeWeb. Below is the basic usage syntax:

```bash
deweb-cli [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]
```

### Global Options

- `--wallet_nickname, -w`: Specify the wallet nickname to use.
- `--node_url, -n`: Specify the node URL.
- `--config, -c`: Load configuration from a specified file path (default: `./deweb_cli_config.yaml`).

## Commands

### upload

Uploads a new website to the DeWeb.

```bash
deweb-cli upload [global options] <website_zip_file_path>
```

#### Arguments

- `<website_zip_file_path>`: Path to the zip file containing the website to be uploaded.

#### Example

```bash
deweb-cli upload -w myWallet -n https://mainnet.massa.net/api/v2 ./website.zip
```

The zip file should contain an `index.html` at its root. For example, if you build an app and the output is in a directory (usually `build` or `dist`), you can zip it using the following command from the output directory:

```bash
zip {name}.zip -r ./*
```

This should result in a zip file with all the files from the output directory, with the `index.html` at its root.

> Note: Server Side Rendering (SSR) is not supported at this time. Ensure your website is fully client-side rendered.

### edit

Edits an existing website on the DeWeb.

```bash
deweb-cli edit [global options] <website_sc_address> <website_zip_file_path>
```

#### Arguments

- `<website_sc_address>`: Smart contract address of the website to be edited.
- `<website_zip_file_path>`: Path to the zip file containing the updated website.

#### Example

```bash
deweb-cli edit -w myWallet -n http://node-url.com <website_sc_address> ./updated_website.zip
```

### delete

Deletes an existing website from the DeWeb.

```bash
deweb-cli delete [global options] <website_sc_address>
```

#### Arguments

- `<website_sc_address>`: Smart contract address of the website to be deleted.

#### Example

```bash
deweb-cli delete -w myWallet -n http://node-url.com <website_sc_address>
```

## Configuration

The CLI can be configured using a JSON file. By default, it looks for `deweb_cli_config.json` in the current directory. You can specify a different configuration file using the `--config | -c`  flag.

### Sample Configuration (`deweb_cli_config.json`)

:::note
Using this config file allows you to stream line uploading process & reduce argument use in commands. We highly recommend that you take full advantage of this. 
:::


```json
{
  "wallet_path": "./wallet_alice.yaml",
  "wallet_password": "42alice0"
  "node_url": "https://buildnet.massa.net/api/v2",
  "chunk_size": "64000"
  "secret_key": "S[...]1"
} 
```


:::info
`wallet_path` should be the path to your Massa Station Wallet yaml file. You can find this file by following this [tutorial](../../massaStation/massa-wallet/account-backup).


Using the `secret_key` allows you to automatically sign transaction with any Massa ecosystem wallet. 

Changing the `chunk_size` allows you to determine the size of uploaded chunks, the bigger they are, the less transaction you need to pay fees for. 
:::


## Logging

The CLI logs its output to `./deweb-cli.log`. Logging is initialized automatically when the application starts.
:::note Disclaimer
The CLI section of the documentation is a work in progress. A complete documentation is coming soon. We appreciate your patience and feedback.
