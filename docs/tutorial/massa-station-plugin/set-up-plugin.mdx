# Set up your plugin's environment

Let'g go through the steps to set up your plugin's environment.

## Install Go

You can install Go [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).


## Initialize the Go plugin:

- Create and navigate to the folder station-massa-hello-world
- Run:

  ```bash
  go mod init github.com/my-username/station-massa-hello-world
  ```

  :::tip

  You can replace `my-username` with your own username, or the name of your organization. Apply the same logic for the rest of the tutorial.

### Create a Logo

- Create the folders `web/content` and add `hello_world.svg` in it.
- Add your custom logo or copy-paste [this one](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-hello-world/blob/main/web/content/hello_world.svg?short_path=1cd8e84):

### Add a manifest file

- Create `manifest.json` in the root of your project.
- Paste the following content, replacing the values with your own:

```json
{
  "author": "My Name",
  "name": "station-massa-hello-world",
  "description": "hello world plugin",
  "logo": "hello_world.svg",
  "home": "",
  "version": "0.0.6",
  "apispec": ""
}
```

You're now ready to start building your plugin!
