# Plugin set-up

Let's go through the steps to set up your plugin's environment.

## Requirements

For this tutorial, you will need:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- The [`go-swagger`](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) package

:::tip
You can install the latest version of `go-swagger` package using:
```shell
go install github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/cmd/swagger@latest
```
:::

## Initialize the Go plugin

First, create and navigate to the folder `my-plugin` and then initialize your project using:
```shell
go mod init my-plugin
```

### Add a logo

We'll now add a logo to our plugin. This logo will be displayed in the Massa Station interface.
For this, create the folder `web/content` and add your logo to it.
You can use a custom logo or copy-paste [this one](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-hello-world/blob/main/web/content/hello_world.svg?short_path=1cd8e84).

### Add a manifest file

Create a `manifest.json` file in the root of your project with the following content, replacing the values with your own:

```json
{
  "author": "My Name",
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "description": "hello world plugin",
  "logo": "hello_world.svg", // the filename of your logo
  "home": "",
  "version": "0.0.6",
  "apispec": ""
}
```

This manifest file provides essential information regarding the plugin that will be displayed in the Massa Station
user interface.

You're now ready to start building your plugin!
