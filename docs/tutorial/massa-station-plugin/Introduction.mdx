This tutorial will show you how to create a simple plugin using Go and Swagger. It is possible to use other languages and frameworks such as explained in the [plugin guidelines](../../build/plugin/guidelines.mdx).
Here, we will rebuild the [Hello world plugin](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-hello-world/tree/main) from scratch as an example.
Following this tutorial, you will learn how a plugin is structured and how to create a plugin with a backend and a frontend.
