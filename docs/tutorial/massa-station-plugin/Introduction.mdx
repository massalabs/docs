This tutorial will show you how to create a simple [plugin](/docs/build/plugin/introduction) for [Massa Station](/docs/build/massa-station/introduction) using Go and Swagger.

Here, we will rebuild the [Hello world plugin](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-hello-world/tree/main) from scratch as an example.
In this tutorial, you will learn how a plugin is structured and how to create a plugin with a backend and a frontend.
The tutorial go through the following steps:

- [Create a basic plugin](./create-plugin-1)
- [Add a new endpoint](./create-plugin-2) to your plugin
- [Add a frontend](./create-plugin-3) to your plugin

But first, let's set up the environment to follow the [plugin guidelines](../../build/plugin/guidelines).
