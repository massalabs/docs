# Non Fungible Token

Non Fungible Tokens are tokens that are individuated and can not be indifferently swaped with each other.
They are commonly known as "NFTs" and can be bound to digital or even real-life assets, to facilitate
trading them via the blockchain. Unlike Fungible Token, NFTs are not tradable on fluid markets, but instead 
must be sold via dedicated platforms, with price established by the owner, or via auctions.
