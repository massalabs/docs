# Fungible Token

Fungible Tokens are tokens that can be indifferently swaped with each other, like coins for example.
This is what is covered by standards such as ERC-20 in the ethereum ecosystem and is commonly known as
a "token" or "alt-coin" in the blockchain jargon.

Because of their fungible nature, fungible tokens are usually traded on fluid markets where they can be
bought and sold in bulks. They have a known price then, which is the price at which the last transaction
took place.
