# Massa Bridge

[Massa Bridge](https://bridge.massa.net/) is the first cross-chain bridge that allows you to transfer ERC-20 tokens from EVM networks to Massa, and vice versa.

It comes with two modes: **Mainnet** (starting with Ethereum and Massa) and **Testnet** (using Sepolia Testnet and Massa Buildnet).

Massa Bridge initially enables the bridging of USDC, DAI, and WETH, originating from the Ethereum blockchain. Synthetic assets received on the Massa blockchain contain a suffix in the token names to identify the origin chain. For example, USDC bridged from Ethereum will become USDC.e on Massa.
