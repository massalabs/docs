### Installation fails because of unsupported OS version. What to do?

For now, Massa Station is only supported on Windows 10 and 11, MacOS 12 and later, and Debian based Linux distributions.

If you are using an unsupported operating system, you can still try to install Massa Station manually by following the instructions on the [manual installation page](/docs/massaStation/manual-install).

### Antivirus blocked installation of Massa Station. What to do?

We want to assure you that Massa Station is free from viruses, and the antivirus warning is a false positive. We're in the process of obtaining necessary certificates (such as from Apple for MacOS versions), which can trigger such warnings.
Being a blockchain app, Massa Station interacts with distant servers and performs cryptographic operations. Antivirus warnings for new apps in this category are common but are mostly not indicative of any threat. If you are using an antivirus that blocks Massa Station, you can try to add Massa Station to the whitelist.

Massa Station’s code is publicly accessible and auditable on [GitHub](https://github.com/massalabs/station), which means that anybody can check what’s happening. It’s part of our commitment to transparency and security.

## Massa Station Usage

### How do I use Massa Station?

We have detailed instructions on how to use Massa Station such as:

- [Browse Decentralized Apps](/docs/massaStation/browse-decentralized-application)
- [Install Massa Wallet](/docs/massaStation/massa-wallet/getting-started)

### Why can't I use Massa Station on mobile?

Massa Station is a desktop super-app that, once opened, operates within your web browser. A mobile version is not available at this time.

### How to connect Massa Station to my own node

For users operating on Debian, Ubuntu, navigate to `~/.config/massa-station`.
For macOS systems, navigate to `~/Library/Application Support/massa-station`.
If you are using Windows, the corresponding directory is `%APPDATA%\massa-station`.
Once there, locate and modify the `config_network.yaml`.
You'll want to append the following lines to the bottom of the file:

```yaml
NodeName:
  URLs:
    - https://my-node-url
  ChainID: <Your node's corresponding chain ID>
  Default: false # or true if you want to set this node as the default
```

Replace `NodeName` with a name of your choosing for the node, this will appear in the dropdown menu.

Make sure that the URL exactly matches the RPC endpoint of your node. This URL is how Massa Station will communicate with your node.
The port of the public API is 33035, so this port must be open on the node server for Massa Station to communicate with your node.
For example: `https://37.167.156.118:33035`.

Additionally, suppose you frequently access a particular node and prefer Massa Station to automatically select this node on start-up.
In that case, you can make it the default node by changing the `Default` field to `true`,
and change the default field for the mainnet node to `false`.

After these lines are added, close and reopen Massa Station. Your newly named node will now be a part of the network selection dropdown menu.
Selecting it will connect Massa Station and its plugins, such as Massa Wallet, to your specified node.

For those whose nodes are on the MainNet, it's essential that the `ChainID` accurately reflects the MainNet's chain ID,
By ensuring the correct `ChainID` is set, your Massa Station will be in sync with the intended network.

### Why can't I access Massa Station from my browser?

Massa Station must be installed and running on your computer to be able to access it from your browser. If you have installed Massa Station, please make sure it is running.

If Massa Station is running, please check that you are using the correct URL. The URL should be `https://station.massa/`.

If you are still having trouble accessing Massa Station, please check the [troubleshooting page](/docs/massaStation/troubleshooting) for help.

### "Install" module button doesn't work. What to do?
