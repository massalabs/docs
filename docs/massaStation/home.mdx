## Introduction to Massa Station

_Massa Station_ is a desktop application that provides an intuitive way to interact with the Massa blockchain through
your web browser.

If you're not a developer or simply prefer a more visual approach, using _Massa Station_ is ideal for you.

_Massa Station_ is the gateway to the Massa Blockchain. You can think of it as an application store for modules that
leverage the exciting features of the Massa Blockchain. _Massa Station_ comes in the form of a desktop application with
some core modules pre-installed. For example, directly out of the box, _Massa Station_ allows you to access Massa's
[Decentralized Web](/docs/learn/decentralized-web).

Once installed on your machine, _Massa Station_ will allow your browser to resolve `.massa` url domains and interact
with decentralized applications hosted on Massa. When using _Massa Station_, the `.massa` url domain indicates that you
are visiting a website that is hosted on-chain, and directly served to you. You can learn more about Decentralized Web
[here](/docs/learn/decentralized-web).

Another core module of _Massa Station_ that is already available is the [Massa Wallet](/build/wallet/massa-station.mdx).
It allows you to manage your Massa accounts, and sign and send transactions with an experience similar to a traditional
browser-plugin wallet, but with enhanced security.

Besides the core modules developed by the Massa team, _Massa Station_ was designed with community and modularity in
mind; indeed, it allows anyone to develop and install their own modules. The most looked upon modules in terms of
community adoption, and upon audit, will be made publicly available through the Massa Plugin Store. We greatly encourage
our community to develop their own modules, as we believe that the _Massa Station_ ecosystem will be the key to the
adoption of the Massa Blockchain.
