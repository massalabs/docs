## Introduction to Massa Station

*Massa Station* is a desktop application that provides an intuitive way to interact with the Massa blockchain through your web browser.

If you're not a developer or simply prefer a more visual approach, using *Massa Station* is ideal for you.

### Installation

#### System Requirements:

- **Operating System**: The latest versions of Windows, Mac, and Debian-based Linux distributions
- **Disk Space**: At least 200 MB
- **RAM**: At least 2 GB

To install *Massa Station*, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Massa Station website](https://station.massa.net/).
2. Click the **Download** button and select the version compatible with your operating system.
3. Once the download is complete, run the installer and follow the instructions.

During the installation process, you will be prompted to grant permissions to *Massa Station*.
These permissions are necessary for *Massa Station* to function correctly.

#### For MacOS:
1. Locate the downloaded .pkg installer file and right-click on it.
2. From the context menu, select "Open" and then click "Open" again in the security pop-up window. This step is necessary because the installer is not signed by the App Store, and MacOS may block the installation by default.
3. If prompted, enter your administrator password to authorize the installation.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the installation.


#### For Windows: 
1. Locate the downloaded .msi installer file and double-click on it to start the installation process.
2. Windows will warn you about untrusted software, click on "more info" and "run anyway" to continue the installation.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the installation. 
4. If prompted, click on "Yes" to allow the installer to make changes on certificates. These certificates allow *Massa Station* to use the HTTPS protocol, which improves your security when [browsing dApp](browse-decentralized-application).


### Modules

*Massa Station* is not just a blockchain client with a user interface; it is a decentralized super app.
You can learn more about the super app concept and its strategic value [here](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-a-superapp).

To achieve evolvability and decentralization, *Massa Station* is designed to be extendable using **modules**, which are also known as **plugins**.

:::tip
If you are unable or do not wish to install a thick client, you can always use one of our [community browser extensions](https://docs.massa.net/docs/build/wallet/community-wallets).
However, by doing so, you will limit your access to the full potential of this super app.
