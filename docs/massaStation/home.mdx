### Modules

*Massa Station* is not just a blockchain client with a user interface; it is a decentralized super app.
You can learn more about the super app concept and its strategic value [here](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/what-is-a-superapp).

To achieve evolvability and decentralization, *Massa Station* is designed to be extendable using **modules**, which are also known as **plugins**.

:::tip
If you are unable or do not wish to install a thick client, you can always use one of our [community browser extensions](https://docs.massa.net/docs/build/wallet/community-wallets).
However, by doing so, you will limit your access to the full potential of this super app.
