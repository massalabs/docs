# Basic concepts

Let's dive into the basic definitions and concepts of Massa blockchain.

The goal of the Massa network is to build a consensus between **nodes** to gather 
and order **blocks** that contain ordered lists of **operations**. 
An operation ultimate purpose once executed is to act as transitions for the global network state, called the **ledger**.

Operations are produced by external clients and sent to the Massa network via a node. Some operations are 
containing code to be run as **smart contracts**, enabling complex programmatic modifications of the ledger. 
Nodes gather pending operations and group them into blocks. Each block has limited space to store operations. 
Traditional blockchains typically link blocks sequentially, including a hash of the previous block in the block 
header for temporal ordering. In contrast, Massa blocks are organized into a complex spatio-temporal structure, 
enabling parallelization and improved block-creation performance.

Instead of one chain, there are exactly 32 **threads** of chains running in parallel, with blocks equally spread on
 each thread over time, and stored inside **slots** that are spaced at fixed time intervals:

The time between two slots located on the same thread is called a **period** and lasts 16s (conventionally called `t0`). 
Corresponding slots in threads are slightly shifted in time relative to one another, by one period divided by the number 
of threads, which is `16s/32 = 0.5s`, so that a period contains exactly 32 slots equally spaced over the 32 threads. 
A **cycle** is defined as the succession of 128 periods and so lasts a bit more than 34min. Periods are numbered by 
increments of one, so can be used together with a thread number to uniquely identify a block slot. Period 0 is the 
genesis and contains genesis blocks with no parents.

The job of the Massa nodes network is to essentially collectively fill up slots with valid blocks. To do so, 
at each interval of 0.5s, a specific node in the network is elected to be allowed to create a block (more about 
the selection process [here](XXX TODO XXX), and the proof of stake sybil resistance mechanism [here](XXX TODO XXX)),
 and will be rewarded if it creates a valid block in time. It is also possible that a node misses its opportunity 
 to create the block, in which case the slot will remain empty (this is called a **block miss**).

In traditional blockchains, blocks are simply referencing their unique parent, forming a chain. In the case of 
Massa, each block is referencing one parent block in each thread (so, 32 parents). Here is an example 
illustrated with one particular block:

Let’s introduce some relevant definitions and concepts generally necessary to understand how the Massa network operates. 
We will then explain the node architecture and how the whole system works.


## Ledger
The ledger is a map that stores a global mapping between addresses and information related to these addresses. 
It is replicated in each node. The consensus building mechanism ensures that agreement on what operations have 
been finalized (and in what order) will be reached over the whole network. The ledger is the state of the Massa network, 
and operations (see below) are requests to modify the ledger. 

The information stored in the ledger with each address is the following:

:::


## Address
Each account in Massa has a public and private key associated with it. This is how messages can be signed and identity enforced.
The address of an account is simply the hash of its public key. 



## Smart Contract
Smart contracts are a piece of code that can be run inside the Massa virtual machine, which can modify the ledger, 
and accept incoming requests through a public interface (via smart contract operations). 

Smart contracts are currently written in AssemblyScript, a stricter derivation from TypeScript, which is itself a 
type-safe version of JavaScript. AssemblyScript compiles to WebAssembly bytecode (wasm). Massa nodes Execution Module runs such bytecode. 
Smart contracts have access to their own datastore, so they can modify the ledger.

### Autonomous Smart Contract
One particularity of Massa smart contracts compared to other blockchain smart contracts is their ability to wake 
up by themselves independently of an exterior request on their interface. We call them Autonomous Smart Contracts, 
as they allow more autonomy and less dependency on external centralized services.

## Operation 
Fundamentally, the point of the Massa network is to gather, order and execute operations. Operations are 
recorded inside blocks that are located in slots. 


### Operation types
There are three types of operations: transactions, roll operations, and smart contract code execution. 
The general structure of an operation is the following, and the different types of operations differ by their payload:

#### Transaction operations
Transactions are operations that move native Massa coins between addresses. Here is the corresponding payload:

:::

#### Buy/Sell Rolls operations
Rolls are staking tokens that participants can buy or sell with native Massa coins. By owning rolls, 
addresses can participate in block creation  [more about staking below](todo). This is done via special operations, with a simple payload:

#### Smart Contract operations
Smart Contracts are pieces of code that can be run inside the Massa virtual machine. There are two ways 
of calling for the execution of code; by direct execution of bytecode, and by a smart-contract function call. 
Former is done using the Execute SC operation, and latter with Call SC operation.

## Block
A block is a data structure built by nodes and its function is to aggregate several operations. As explained above, 
for each new slot that becomes active, a particular node in the network is elected in a deterministic way with the 
task of creating the block that will be stored in that slot (more about this in the description of the Selector 
Module below). A block from a given thread can only contain operations originating from a creator_public_key whose 
hash’s five first bits designate the corresponding thread, thus implicitly avoiding collisions in operations integrated into parallel threads.

### Endorsements
Endorsements are optional inclusion in the block, but their inclusion is incentivized for block creators. They are 
validations of the fact that the parent block on the thread of the block is the best parent that could have been 
chosen, done by other nodes that have also been deterministically selected via the proof of stake probability 
distribution (see below). A comprehensive description of endorsements can be found [here](todo), so we will 
not go further into details in the context of this introduction.
