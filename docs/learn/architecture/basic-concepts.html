markdown"><h1>Basic concepts</h1><p>Let&#x27;s dive into the basic definitions and concepts of Massa blockchain.</p><p>The goal of the Massa network is to build a consensus between <strong>nodes</strong> to gather
and order <strong>blocks</strong> that contain ordered lists of <strong>operations</strong>.
An operation ultimate purpose once executed is to act as transitions for the global network state, called the <strong>ledger</strong>.</p><p>Operations are produced by external clients and sent to the Massa network via a node.
Some operations are containing code to be run as <strong>smart contracts</strong>, enabling complex programmatic
modifications of the ledger.
Nodes gather pending operations and group them into blocks. Each block has limited space to store operations.
Traditional blockchains typically link blocks sequentially, including a hash of the previous block in the block
header for temporal ordering. In contrast, Massa blocks are organized into a complex spatio-temporal structure,
enabling parallelization and improved block-creation performance.</p><p>Instead of one chain, there are exactly 32 <strong>threads</strong> of chains running in parallel, with blocks equally
spread on each thread over time, and stored inside <strong>slots</strong> that are spaced at fixed time intervals:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/structure.drawio-5ccea2d6795f98b55e11a04ae9ce1ae7.svg" width="887" height="387" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The time between two slots located on the same thread is called a <strong>period</strong> and lasts 16s (conventionally called <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>t</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t_0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7651em;vertical-align:-0.15em"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">0</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>).
Corresponding slots in threads are slightly shifted in time relative to one another, by one period divided by the number
of threads, which is <span class="math math-inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>16</mn><mi>s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>32</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>0.5</mn><mi>s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">16s/32 = 0.5s</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em"></span><span class="mord">16</span><span class="mord mathnormal">s</span><span class="mord">/32</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em"></span><span class="mord">0.5</span><span class="mord mathnormal">s</span></span></span></span></span>, so that a period contains exactly 32 slots equally spaced over the 32 threads.
A <strong>cycle</strong> is defined as the succession of 128 periods and so lasts a bit more than 34min. Periods are numbered by
increments of one, so can be used together with a thread number to uniquely identify a block slot. Period 0 is the
genesis and contains genesis blocks with no parents.</p><p>The job of the Massa nodes network is to essentially collectively fill up slots with valid blocks. To do so,
at each interval of 0.5s, a specific node in the network is elected to be allowed to create a block (more about
the selection process and the proof of stake sybil resistance mechanism <a href="/docs/learn/architecture/node-architecture#selector-module-proof-of-stake-sybil-resistance">here</a>),
and will be rewarded if it creates a valid block in time. It is also possible that a node misses its opportunity
to create the block, in which case the slot will remain empty (this is called a <strong>block miss</strong>).</p><p>In traditional blockchains, blocks are simply referencing their unique parent, forming a chain. In the case of
Massa, each block is referencing one parent block in each thread (so, 32 parents). Here is an example
illustrated with one particular block:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/block_parents.drawio-38637c12a34e50307bf25a25f082254d.svg" width="887" height="328" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Let’s introduce some relevant definitions and concepts generally necessary to understand how the Massa network operates.
We will then explain the node architecture and how the whole system works.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ledger">Ledger<a href="#ledger" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ledger" title="Direct link to Ledger">​</a></h2><p>The ledger is a map that stores a global mapping between addresses and information related to these addresses.
It is replicated in each node. The consensus building mechanism ensures that agreement on what operations have
been finalized (and in what order) will be reached over the whole network. The ledger is the state of the Massa network,
and operations (see below) are requests to modify the ledger. </p><p>The information stored in the ledger with each address is the following:</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="1"><p>Ledger Information Associated with Each Address</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>balance</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The amount of Massa coins owned by the address.</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>bytecode</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>When the address references a smart contract, this is the compiled code corresponding to the smart contract (typically contains several functions that act as API entry points).</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>datastore</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>A key/value map that can store any persistent data related to a smart contract, its variables, etc.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In order to promote widespread adoption and facilitate node running with reduced entry fees, the size of the ledger in Massa
has been limited to a maximum of 1 TB.
This decision sets Massa apart from other benchmark blockchain ledgers and makes it more accessible to users.</p><p>To achieve such a small ledger size, several technical decisions were made.
Firstly, state changes that have been finalized and are found in the final Blocks no longer require record-keeping in the Ledger&#x27;s memory.
This optimization helps minimize the storage requirements for historical data, allowing the ledger to operate efficiently within the specified size limit.</p><p>In addition to this, Massa has introduced <a href="/docs/learn/storage-costs">Storage Costs</a> as a novel approach to enhance storage efficiency.
Users are now required to lock a certain amount of coins when they claim storage space.
This innovative correlation between storage and circulating coins ensures a balanced utilization of resources.
By implementing this mechanism, Massa optimizes storage utilization while maintaining the integrity and security of the ledger.</p><p>These technical decisions, including the exclusion of finalized state changes from ledger memory and the introduction of Storage
Costs, play a crucial role in enabling the compact size of the ledger and ultimately facilitating a more efficient and accessible
blockchain ecosystem.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="address">Address<a href="#address" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Address" title="Direct link to Address">​</a></h2><p>An address on the Massa blockchain serves as your unique identity, granting you the ability to engage in various operations,
store information, and exchange data with other participants. With an address, you gain access to a wide range of functionalities
within the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>Using your address, you can initiate operations that interact with the blockchain.
This includes executing transactions, submitting smart contract calls, and engaging in other blockchain activities.
Your address acts as the key to unlock these capabilities, allowing you to participate fully in the decentralized network.</p><p>Furthermore, your address enables you to store and retrieve information on the blockchain. Whether it&#x27;s personal data, financial records, or any other form of digital information, you can securely store it using your address as the reference. This provides a reliable and immutable storage solution within the blockchain environment.</p><p>Importantly, your address also facilitates communication and data exchange with other participants on the blockchain.
By sharing your address with others, you can interact, transact, and collaborate with different individuals and entities
within the blockchain network.
This seamless exchange of data and value promotes a decentralized and interconnected ecosystem.</p><p>Each user address on Massa has a public and private key associated with it.
This is how messages can be signed and identity enforced.
The address of an account is simply the hash of its public key. </p><p>Addresses are generated using a specific format that includes a prefix <code>A</code> and a base58 encoding. The prefix distinguishes between user addresses, linked to a KeyPair, and smart-contract addresses, denoted by the prefixes <code>U</code> or <code>S</code> respectively.</p><p>For user addresses (AU), the hash calculation involves taking the Blake3 hash of the byte representation of
the user&#x27;s public key.
This process ensures a unique and secure identification for each user address within the system.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="smart-contract">Smart Contract<a href="#smart-contract" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Smart Contract" title="Direct link to Smart Contract">​</a></h2><p>Smart contracts are a piece of code that can be run inside the Massa virtual machine, which can modify the ledger,
and accept incoming requests through a public interface (via smart-contract operations). </p><p>Smart contracts are currently written in AssemblyScript, a derivation from TypeScript, which is itself a
type-safe version of JavaScript. AssemblyScript compiles to WebAssembly bytecode (wasm). Massa nodes Execution Module runs such bytecode.
Smart contracts have access to their own datastore, so they can modify the ledger.</p><p>Smart contracts follow a different hash calculation than user addresses. It begins by constructing a byte array comprising various elements.
This array consists of the slot represented in 5 bytes, with 4 bytes allocated for the period (encoded as a u64 in big endian
format), 1 byte for the thread, and an index that increments for each address created within the same slot.
The index value is represented as a u64 in big endian format and is reset at the start of each new slot.
Additionally, a single byte is appended to indicate whether the address is for real execution (1) or read-only execution (0).</p><p>The resulting byte array is then subject to the Blake3 hash function, generating a unique
hash value that serves as the SC address.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="autonomous-smart-contract-execution">Autonomous Smart Contract Execution<a href="#autonomous-smart-contract-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Autonomous Smart Contract Execution" title="Direct link to Autonomous Smart Contract Execution">​</a></h3><p>One particularity of Massa smart contracts compared to other blockchain smart contracts is their ability to wake
up by themselves independently of an exterior request on their interface. We call them Autonomous Smart Contracts (ASCs),
as they allow more autonomy and less dependency on external centralized services.</p><p>ASCs offer a plethora of use cases that leverage their self wake-up functionality.
In the realm of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), these contracts can automate liquidations,
yield farming strategies, and portfolio rebalancing.
Supply chain management benefits from autonomous contracts through automated inventory management and quality control processes.
In the insurance industry, claims settlements can be accelerated with instant payments and parametric insurance.
Gaming and NFT platforms can provide dynamic and interactive experiences with evolving NFTs and automated auctions.

Having a massive ledger size (hundreds of terabytes), would pose high entry barriers for potential node runners. To ensure smooth operation and enable node hosting at home, it&#x27;s essential to establish a reasonable size limit, and remove the need for excessive storage capacity. After careful consideration, we have determined that a storage size limit of 1TB strikes the right balance. This means that each participant can store data on the ledger until it reaches the 1TB threshold. By implementing this limit, we aim to promote widespread adoption and empower individuals to run nodes effortlessly. </p><p>In order to enforce this limit, users are required to lock a corresponding amount of coins for each byte of storage they claim. This applies to various data elements such as your address, balance, keys in your datastore, bytecode, and more. By locking coins, you establish a commitment that ensures fair usage of storage resources. Once you release your allocated space in the storage, the locked coins are subsequently released as well. This mechanism guarantees a balanced and accountable approach to managing storage within the network.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>Read more about storage costs <a href="/docs/learn/storage-costs">here</a>.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gas">Gas<a href="#gas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Gas" title="Direct link to Gas">​</a></h2><p>In Massa, there is no Gas price.

The byte array encompasses the version in a u64 varint format, the Blake3 hash of the fully serialized content

There are two ways
of calling for the execution of code; by direct execution of bytecode, and by a smart-contract function call.
Former is done using the Execute SC operation, and latter with Call SC operation.</p><ol><li><p>Execute SC operation</p><p>The ExecuteSC operation provides a powerful functionality within the Massa network by enabling the execution of smart contracts
directly instead of storing them.
Instead of storing the bytecode, the code itself is placed within the operation as a smart contract.
When the ExecuteSC operation is executed, the blockchain triggers the execution of the main function within
the smart contract code. After the code is executed, the blockchain proceeds to other tasks while retaining
and reflecting the changes made to the ledger and other relevant data.
This approach ensures that the executed changes are recorded and maintained on the ledger, rather than
retaining the bytecode itself.
By executing smart contracts in this manner, the Massa network offers flexibility and efficiency
in managing and executing code within its blockchain ecosystem.</p></li></ol><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><p>Execute SC Payload Binary Representation</p></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Field</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Description</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Type</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>max_gas</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The maximum gas spendable for this operation</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>u64 varint</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>bytecode_len</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The length of the bytecode field</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>u64 varint</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>bytecode</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The bytecode to run (in the context of the caller address)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>datastore_len</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The number of the datastore keys (u64 varint), each record is then stored one after another</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>u64 varint</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>list of datastore records</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Concatenation of <code>key_len</code> (u8), <code>key</code>, <code>value_len</code> (u64 varint), <code>value</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><ol start="2"><li>Call SC operation</li></ol><p>Here, the code is indirectly called via the call to an existing smart contract function, together with the required parameters:</p><table><thead><tr><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><p>Call SC Payload Binary Representation</p></th></tr><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Field</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Description</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Type</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>max_gas</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The maximum gas spendable for this operation</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>u64 varint</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>coins</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The coins transferred in the call</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>u64 varint</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>target_address</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The address of the targeted smart contract</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>32 bytes</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>function_name_length</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The length of the name of the function that is called</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>u8</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>function_name</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The name of the function that is called</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>utf8</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>param_len</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The number of parameters of the function call</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>u64 varint</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><code>params</code></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>The parameters of the function call</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operation-lifecycle">Operation lifecycle<a href="#operation-lifecycle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operation lifecycle" title="Direct link to Operation lifecycle">​</a></h3><p>Massa&#x27;s maximal theoretical throughput is about 10k operations per second, with low hardware requirements for validators to improve decentralization.

Block retrieval in Massa makes use of the propagation caches to only ask for operations that are not already known by the current peer.
This effectively avoids re-doing operation propagation and legality checks for block operations that have already propagated by themselves previously.</p><p>When a block is received, if any of the following happen the block is rejected (and its senders are banned):</p><ul><li>any included operation is not legal (TODO redirect to legality section)</li><li>the batched parallel signature verification of all the block operations is not a success</li><li>the block operations root hash does not match the one in the header</li><li>the cumulated size of all the operations in the block is strictly above 1MB</li></ul><p>This detects non-legal blocks early and prevents them from propagating in the network.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operation-execution">Operation execution<a href="#operation-execution" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operation execution" title="Direct link to Operation execution">​</a></h4><p>When the consensus algorithm outputs the list of slots to execute,
that list is fed to the Execution thread that executes slots asynhronously, in time order.</p><p>The execution thread executes slots in order following two cursors: a candidate cursor and a final cursor.</p><p>The candidate cursor attempts to execute all slots up to 2 seconds in the past.
If a blockclique change happens, the candidate cursor is rolled back to the earliest slot that changed,
and re-executes all the slots from there.
This means that the execution state and outcomes of an operation executed in a non-final slot can change at any time.
The 2 second latency serves the purpose of avoiding constant re-execution of the very volatile latest slots
in order to save resources.
This means that the candidate execution state of an operation can be observed after two seconds (or more)
following the propagation of the block in which it was included.
Overall, the deeper the slot is in the past, the exponentially more stable its candidate execution state is,
up to finality after which it is guaranteed not to change anymore. </p><p>The final cursor attempts to execute all final slots up to the latest one.
Final execution is prioritary over candidate execution:
as long as there are slots to finalize, they are processed before candidate slots.
If a finalizing slot was previously executed as candidate and neither itself nor any if its ancestors has changed since the execution,
the results of the slot&#x27;s candidate execution are simply written to the final state to avoid re-executing it.</p><p>When a slot is executed, if it contains a block, that block is executed.
THe block&#x27;s operations are tentatively executed in the order they appear in the block.
For each operation in a block, the following is performed:</p><ul><li>Gas check: if the remaining block gas (starting from <code>MAX_BLOCK_GAS = 4294967295</code>) is not enough to supply the operation&#x27;s <code>max_gas</code>, the operation is ignored.</li><li>Thread check: if the thread of the operation sender does not match the thread of the block, the operation is ignored.</li><li>Period check: if the slot period of the block is not within the range of validity periods of the operation, the operation is ignored. The validity period interval of an operation <code>Op</code> is: <code>[expiration_period - 10, expiration_period]</code>.</li><li>Reuse check: if the operation is in the list of executed operations, the operation is ignored.</li><li>Fee spending: spend the fee from the sender&#x27;s account. If this spending fails, ignore the operation.</li><li>Subtract the operation&#x27;s <code>max_gas</code> from the remaining block gas.</li><li>Add the operation to the list of executed operations. Note that operations with an expiry period that is earlier or equal to the latest final period in the operation&#x27;s thread are removed from this list after 10 extra periods in order to cap memory use.</li><li>If any of the previous steps failed, the operation is considered <strong>NOT EXECUTED</strong>, it is ignored and the block producer does not pocket any fees from it while wasting block space. Block producers should therefore be careful about the operations they choose to include or they might not get any fees from them. Thanks to sharding and the declarative <code>max_gas</code> and <code>max_coins</code> operation fields, block prodcuers can keep track of balances and gas usage without having to simulate the complete execution of candidate operations in order to avoid this pitfall.</li><li>From there on, the operation is considered executed.</li><li>Run the payload of the operation (for example call a smart contract). This can succeed or fail.<ul><li>In case of payload run failure, all the consequences of the payload run are rolled back, but the fee is still spent and the operation is still considered executed. This is because block producers have not enough computing power to simulate running all pending operations: this failure is the operation producer&#x27;s responsibility. In this case, the operation is then considered <strong>EXECUTED WITH FAILURE</strong>.</li><li>In case of payload run success, the consequences of the execution are kept, and the operation is considered <strong>EXECUTED WITH SUCCESS</strong>.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Different types of operations have different payload run failure cases:</p><ul><li><code>Transaction</code>: fails if the balance of the origin account is not enough to cover the amount of the transaction.</li><li><code>RollBuy</code>: fails if the balance of the origin account is not enough to cover the amount of the roll buy.</li><li><code>RollSell</code>: fails if the the origin account has not enough rolls to sell.</li><li><code>CallSC</code>: fails if any of the following happen:<ul><li>the balance of the origin account is not enough to cover the coins being transferred</li><li>the target smart contract is not found</li><li>the target smart contract has invalid bytecode</li><li>the target smart contract exposes no function with the given name and expected prototype.</li><li>the smart contract execution in the VM exceeds <code>max_gas</code></li><li>the smart contract execution in the VM raises a runtime exception</li></ul></li><li><code>ExecuteSC</code>: fails if any of the following happen:<ul><li>the bytecode is invalid</li><li>the bytecode does not expose a <code>main</code> function with the right prototype</li><li>the smart contract execution in the VM exceeds <code>max_gas</code></li><li>the smart contract execution in the VM raises a runtime exception</li><li>the smart contract execution spends more than <code>max_coins</code> from the sender account</li></ul></li></ul><p>The operation execution process in Massa implies some peculiarities:</p><ul><li>the same operation can be included zero, one or many times in the same block or in different blocks but is executed either 0 or 1 times in total</li><li>it is not because an operation is included in a final block that the operation is executed as final</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operation-pool-and-operation-inclusion">Operation pool and operation inclusion<a href="#operation-pool-and-operation-inclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operation pool and operation inclusion" title="Direct link to Operation pool and operation inclusion">​</a></h4><p>When creating blocks, block producers are free to include the operations they want in their blocks with certain constraints
that would make the block non-legal and rejected at reception if they are not respected:</p><ul><li>all operations in the block need to be well-formed</li><li>all the signatures of the included operations need to be legal</li><li>the cumulated size of all the operations in the block must be at most 1MB</li></ul><p>Block producers keep candidate operations in their operation pool.
However, memory constraints on block producer hardware require regular pruning of this pool to keep it small and tailored to the block producer&#x27;s needs:</p><ul><li>discard operations that do not match the legality constraints listed above</li><li>discard operations that can not be included by this block producer given the expiry periods of the operation and proof-of-stake draws</li></ul><p>Block producers maximize their gains by prioritizing the operations that maximize their expected rewards.
However, they don&#x27;t have the computational power to simulate the execution of all potential operations.</p><p>To solve this problem, operations are scored by block producers to estimate their expected rewards.
This is done by a scoring algorithm that takes into account:</p><ul><li>the expected rewards coming from the operation&#x27;s <code>fee</code></li><li>the probability of executing of the operation based on:<ul><li>whether the operation was already executed previously</li><li>the number of opportunities other block producers have to execute the operation before the current node gets a chance to include it based on proof-of-stake selections</li></ul></li><li>the usage of resources by the operation:<ul><li>the operation size (occupying space in the finite block size)</li><li>the operation <code>max_gas</code> (occupying gas in the finite block gas <code>MAX_BLOCK_GAS</code>)
Operations are then kept sorted by score, and the ones with the worst scores are discarded to respect the max size of the pool.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Sorted operations are then scanned based on their declarative coin spending (<code>fee + max_coins</code>)
and operations that overflow their sender&#x27;s candidate balance given those cumulated spendings are discarded.
The accurate evaluation of the balance without execution is made possible by sharding:
no operation executed in blocks being created elsewhere at the same time can spend those coins.
This protects the pool from flood attacks and guarantees that the operation fees can be spent.</p><p>In Massa, operation pools are highly non-deterministic and depend on each block producer&#x27;s proof-of-stake draws.
The operation pool can therefore not be used as a reliable source of information about the propagation state of an operation.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operation-execution-status-and-finality">Operation execution status and finality<a href="#operation-execution-status-and-finality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operation execution status and finality" title="Direct link to Operation execution status and finality">​</a></h4><p>Because of the peculiar way Massa handles operations to achieve its scalability, security and decentralization goals,
tracking the state of execution of an operation requires understanding certain principles.</p><p>At the output of an executed slot <code>S</code>, an operation can be in one of the following observable states:</p><ul><li><code>EXECUTABLE_OR_EXPIRED</code>: the operation is not in the list of previously executed operations at the output of <code>S</code>:<ul><li>If the operation&#x27;s expiry date is earlier or equal to the period of <code>S</code>, then the operation can not be executed anymore:<ul><li>The operation might never have been executed previously</li><li>The operation might have been executed in a slot that finalized more than 10 periods ago. This is because the list of executed operations is pruned to limit its memory usage (see TODO operation execution).</li></ul></li><li>Otherwise, it means that the operation was never executed and can be executed in the future.</li></ul></li><li><code>EXECUTED_WITH_SUCCESS</code>: the operation was executed at or before <code>S</code> and its payload run was successful (see TODO link op exec). The operation can not be executed anymore.</li><li><code>EXECUTED_WITH_FAILURE</code>: the operation was executed at or before <code>S</code> and its payload run generated errors (see TODO link op exec). The operation can not be executed anymore.</li></ul><p>If the slot <code>S</code> is the latest candidate slot, then the observed status of a given operation at the output of <code>S</code> is considered candidate.
As candidate slots are executed, candidate operation states can transition from any state into any other because blockclique changes might happen and rewrite the slot history.</p><p>If the slot <code>S</code> is the latest executed final slot, then the observed status of a given operation at the output of <code>S</code> is considered final.
As final slots are executed, the following final operation state transitions can be observed:</p><ul><li><code>EXECUTABLE_OR_EXPIRED</code> -&gt; <code>EXECUTED_WITH_SUCCESS</code>: the operation was executed as final with success</li><li><code>EXECUTABLE_OR_EXPIRED</code> -&gt; <code>EXECUTED_WITH_SUCCESS</code>: the operation was executed as final with failure</li><li><code>EXECUTED_WITH_SUCCESS</code> -&gt; <code>EXECUTABLE_OR_EXPIRED</code>: the operation was executed as final with success and then it expired and was pruned away</li><li><code>EXECUTED_WITH_FAILURE</code> -&gt; <code>EXECUTABLE_OR_EXPIRED</code>: the operation was executed as final with failure and then it expired and was pruned away</li></ul><p>Operations are guaranteed to be kept in the <code>EXECUTED_WITH_SUCCESS</code> or <code>EXECUTED_WITH_FAILURE</code> state for at least 10 periods (2 minutes and 40 seconds)
to give enough time for operators to register those states before they are pruned.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="endorsements">Endorsements<a href="#endorsements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Endorsements" title="Direct link to Endorsements">​</a></h3><p>Endorsements are optionally included in the block, but their inclusion is incentivized for block creators.
