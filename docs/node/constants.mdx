# Network constants

This page describes the constants governing the behavior of the network and their values (that are the same for all nodes of a given network).
These tables are obtained from the source code of the node, in the [massa repository](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/blob/MAIN.2.4/massa-models/src/config/constants.rs),
and are used in various massa projects, for instance:

- Smart contract related constants in [Massa-web3](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3/blob/main/src/smartContracts/constants.ts)
- Operation related constants in [Massa Station](https://github.com/massalabs/station/blob/main/pkg/node/sendoperation/sendoperation.go#L17)

## Consensus related constants

The following constants directly impact the security of the network's consensus.

| Constant | Description | Value |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| ROLL_PRICE | The price of a Roll, in MAS | `100` |
| BLOCK_REWARD | The max number of MAS created as reward for block and endorsement production | `1.02` |
| POS_MISS_RATE_DEACTIVATION_THRESHOLD | A staker's roll will auto-sell if they miss more than the given threshold of selected block to produce during a given cycle | `70%` |

| MAX_BOOTSTRAP_MESSAGE_SIZE | Max message size for bootstrap, in bytes | `300_000_000` |
| VERSIONING_THRESHOLD_TRANSITION_ACCEPTED | Threshold of votes to accept a new Massa Improvement Proposal (MIP), considering the latest MIP_STORE_STATS_BLOCK_CONSIDERED blocks  | `75%` |
| MIP_STORE_STATS_BLOCK_CONSIDERED | Number of blocks to consider for votes on a MIP | `1_000` |

## Execution related constants

The following constants relate to Massa's execution module, and define ledger storage costs, gas usage and smart contract limitations.

### Base constants
