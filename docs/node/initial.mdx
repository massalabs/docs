# Installing an Initial Node

Congratulations !
If your address has non-zero initial rolls [in this listing](https://github.com/Massa-Foundation/genesis-ledger/blob/main/node_initial_setup/initial_rolls.json)
then you are among the happy initial node runners that were chosen to support the mainnet from day zero.

This means that you will be running a node BEFORE the planned genesis that will happen January 15th, which implies that:
* your node needs to be set up as soon as possible, at most on January 14th
* there are no blocks before genesis, so no operations/transactions, and therefore no roll buys / roll sells. This means that the setup procedure is just slightly different compared to testnet.
* only initial node runners like you will be present, so you will most likely have a lot of block prodcution and rewards

## Requirements

You need to have a wallet for which the address has non-zero coins here [in this listing](https://github.com/Massa-Foundation/genesis-ledger/blob/main/node_initial_setup/initial_rolls.json).
You will be using this wallet.

You need a computer with 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, 1TB disk and a decent internet connection.
More info in the [FAQ](/docs/node/faq).

## Step 1: Installation

### Installing from binaries (simple installation)

If you just wish to run a Massa node without compiling it yourself, you can simply download the latest binary below:

- [Windows executable](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/MAIN.1.0/massa_MAIN.1.0_release_windows.zip)
- [Linux binary](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/MAIN.1.0/massa_MAIN.1.0_release_linux.tar.gz) - 
only works with libc2.28 and higher (for example Ubuntu 20.04 and higher)
- [MacOS binary](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/MAIN.1.0/massa_MAIN.1.0_release_macos_aarch64.tar.gz)
- Other binaries can be found on https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/tag/MAIN.1.0

### Installing from source code (advanced installation)

Otherwise, if you wish to run a Massa node from source code, here are the steps to follow:

#### On Ubuntu / MacOS

- on Ubuntu, these libs must be installed: ```sudo apt install pkg-config curl git build-essential libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake```
- on MacOS: ```brew install llvm cmake```
- install [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): ```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```
- configure path: ```source $HOME/.cargo/env```
- check rust version: ```rustc --version```
- install rust stable version: ```rustup toolchain install 1.74.1```
- set it as default: ```rustup default 1.74.1```
- check rust version: ```rustc --version```
- clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/massalabs/massa.git```

#### On Windows

**Set up your Rust environment**:
- On Windows, you should first follow the indications from Microsoft to be able to run on a Rust environment [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup).
    - Install Visual Studio (recommended) or the Microsoft C++ Build Tools.
    - Once Visual Studio is installed, click on C++ Build Tool. Select on the right column called "installation details" the following packages:
        - MSCV v142 -- VS 2019
        - Windows 10 SDK
        - C++ CMake tools for Windows
        - Testing Tools Core Feature
    - Click install on the bottom right to download and install those packages
- Install NASM: https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.16.01/ choose win32 or win64 folder depending on your architecture and download then launch the installer.
- Install Chocolatey and run: ```choco install llvm cmake```
- Install Rust, to be downloaded [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install Git for windows, to be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

**Clone the Massa Git Repository**:
- Open Windows Power Shell
    - Clone the latest distributed version: ```git clone https://github.com/massalabs/massa.git```
    - Change default Rust to the following stable version: ```rustup default 1.74.1```


## Step 2: Configuration

Now that your node is installed, you need to configure it.

### If your node was installed from binaries (simple installation)

Simply run the binaries you downloaded in the previous step:

- Open the massa-node folder and run the massa-node executable
- Open the massa-client folder and run the massa-client executable

#### On Ubuntu / MacOS

**Start the node**

In a first window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-node/
```

Launch the node, on Ubuntu:

```shell
./massa-node -p <PASSWORD> |& tee logs.txt
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node You should leave the window opened.

**Start the client**

In a second window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-client/
```

Then:

```shell
./massa-client -p <PASSWORD>
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your client

### If your node was installed from source code (advanced installation)

#### On Ubuntu / MacOS

**Start the node**

In a first window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-node/
```

Launch the node, on Ubuntu:

```shell
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD> |& tee logs.txt
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node

Or, on MacOS:

```shell
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD> > logs.txt 2>&1
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node You should leave the window opened.

**Start the client**

On a second window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-client/
```

Then:

```shell
cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD>
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password. You will need this password to restart your client. Please wait until the
directories are built before moving to the next step.

#### On Windows

**Start the Node**

- Open Windows Power Shell or Command Prompt on a first window
    - Type: ```cd massa```
    - Type: ```cd massa-node```
    - Type: ```cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD>```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password. You will need this password to restart your node. You should leave the window
opened.

**Start the Client**

- Open Windows Power Shell or Command Prompt on a second window
    - Type: cd massa
    - Type: cd massa-client
    - Type: ```cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD>```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password. You will need this password to restart your client. Please wait until the
directories are built before moving to the next step.

:::caution

In case of crash of the Rust compiler or at runtime, please do not report bugs to the rustlang/rust repository, but
[open an issue](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/issues/new/choose) on the Massa repository instead. We will triage
the issues and open them on the Rust side if they are valid. This avoids polluting the main Rust repository with many
reports of the same error.

## Step 3: Activating the staking wallet

Now that your node and client are running, you need to activate the staking wallet matching the one that has initial rolls.

### Importing your wallet in the client

You need to provide the wallet that matches your staking address (the one that has initial rolls) to the client.
Any other wallet would result in your node not staking.

The procedure depends on how you have saved your wallet in the first place.

#### If you have saved your secret/private key

Then you can import it in the client using the following command:
```
TODO
```

#### If you have saved an encrypted wallet file


Then you can import it in the client by 
TODO


### Enabling staking on your node

You now need to tell your node that it needs to stake using your initial staking wallet.

Get the address that has initial rolls in your wallet:

```shell
wallet_info
```

Register your address so that your node start to stake with it:

```shell
node_start_staking <your_address>
```

TODO command to check that the address is registered for staking

Now you can leave the node running, and it will start producing blocks just after Genesis!
