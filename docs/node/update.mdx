# Updating a node

If you use the binaries, simply download the latest binaries. Otherwise if you have built from source, follow the
instructions below.

Make sure you have all the packages installed on your system. Maybe new one could have been added since you last release
refer to our [documentation](./install.html#from-source-code-advanced-installation) for the updated list.

Make sure you you have the right git repository:

```shell
cd massa/
git stash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/massalabs/massa.git
```

Update Massa:

```shell
git checkout testnet
git pull
```

After updating, enter the command `node_get_staking_addresses` in your client and make sure that it returns an address
that has rolls according to wallet_info.

- If `wallet_info` does not return any address, it means that you haven't backed up your wallet.dat correctly. Close the
client, overwrite wallet.dat with your backup, launch the client again and try again. You can also create a new address
by calling `wallet_generate_secret_key`.
- If you can't find an address in `wallet_info` that has non-zero candidate, non-zero final and non-zero active rolls,
please refer to the [staking tutorial](./stake) on getting rolls.
- If `node_get_staking_addresses` does not return any address or does not return an address that has active_rolls
according to wallet_info, it means you haven't backed up `staking_keys.json` properly. Try stopping the node,
overwriting `staking_keys.json` with your backup, and starting the node again to try again. You can also manually add a
staking key by calling `add_staking_keys` with the `KEY` matching the address that has active rolls in wallet_info
(warning: do not type the address or public key, only the `SECRET KEY`).
