## From binaries (simple installation)

If you just wish to run a Massa node without compiling it yourself, you can simply download the latest binary below and
go to the next step: [Running a node](/docs/node/run).

- [Windows executable](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/MAIN.2.1/massa_MAIN.2.1_release_windows.zip)
- [Linux binary](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/MAIN.2.1/massa_MAIN.2.1_release_linux.tar.gz) - 
only works with libc2.28 and higher (for example Ubuntu 20.04 and higher)
- [MacOS binary](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/MAIN.2.1/massa_MAIN.2.1_release_macos_aarch64.tar.gz)
- Other binaries can be found on https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/tag/MAIN.2.1

## From source code (advanced installation)

Otherwise, if you wish to run a Massa node from source code, here are the steps to follow:

### On Ubuntu / MacOS

- on Ubuntu, these libs must be installed: ```sudo apt install pkg-config curl git build-essential libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake```
- on MacOS: ```brew install llvm cmake```
- install [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): ```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```
- configure path: ```source $HOME/.cargo/env```
- check rust version: ```rustc --version```
- install rust stable version: ```rustup toolchain install 1.74.1```
- set it as default: ```rustup default 1.74.1```
- check rust version: ```rustc --version```
- clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/massalabs/massa.git```

### On Windows

**Set up your Rust environment**:
- On Windows, you should first follow the indications from Microsoft to be able to run on a Rust environment [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup).
    - Install Visual Studio (recommended) or the Microsoft C++ Build Tools.
    - Once Visual Studio is installed, click on C++ Build Tool. Select on the right column called "installation details" the following packages:
        - MSCV v142 -- VS 2019
        - Windows 10 SDK
        - C++ CMake tools for Windows
        - Testing Tools Core Feature
    - Click install on the bottom right to download and install those packages
- Install NASM: https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.16.01/ choose win32 or win64 folder depending on your architecture and download then launch the installer.
- Install Chocolatey and run: ```choco install llvm cmake```
- Install Rust, to be downloaded [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install Git for windows, to be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

**Clone the Massa Git Repository**:
- Open Windows Power Shell
    - Clone the latest distributed version: ```git clone https://github.com/massalabs/massa.git```
    - Change default Rust to the following stable version: ```rustup default 1.74.1```

## My node is installed. What next ?

Once you have installed your node, you want to set it up for running and staking.
Before running the node, you should configure it to be routable as indicated [here](routability#how-to-make-your-node-routable).
Without it, your node will be unstable through lack of connectivity.
