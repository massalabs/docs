# Installing a node

:::info

Right now 4 cores and 8 GB of RAM should be enough to run a node, but it might increase in the future.
More info in the [FAQ](/docs/node/faq).

## From Massa station (simplest installation)

If you wish to run a Massa node with a couple of clicks only, you can download Massa station app and activate the node-manager
plugin. This will enable you to configure, install, start and even update a node using a simple graphical interface.
For that, there are 5 steps to follow:

1. Install Massa station based on your OS:
    - [Windows](https://github.com/massalabs/station/releases/latest/download/massastation_windows_amd64.exe)
    - MacOS
        - For Apple Silicon CPUs (M1, M2...), use
        [ARM](https://github.com/massalabs/station/releases/latest/download/massastation_darwin_arm64)
        - For Intel CPUs (i5, i7...), use
        [AMD](https://github.com/massalabs/station/releases/latest/download/massastation_darwin_amd64)
    - [Linux](https://github.com/massalabs/station/releases/latest/download/massastation_linux_amd64)
2. Start Massa station using the icon tray. If you need help,
[this page](https://github.com/massalabs/station/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) can help.
3. [Configure your VPS](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-node-manager/wiki) and go to
[station home page](https://my.massa/station/home/).
4. Install the node-manager plugin.
5. Add your VPS details and click on "start".
6. You're now a Massa node-runner!

## From binaries (simple installation)

If you just wish to run a Massa node without compiling it yourself, you can simply download the latest binary below and
go to the next step: [Running a node](/docs/node/run).

- [Windows executable](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/TEST.24.1/massa_TEST.24.1_release_windows.zip)
- [Linux binary](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/TEST.24.1/massa_TEST.24.1_release_linux.tar.gz) - 
only works with libc2.28 and higher (for example Ubuntu 20.04 and higher)
- [MacOS binary](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/TEST.24.1/massa_TEST.24.1_release_macos.tar.gz)

## From source code (advanced installation)
