# Installing a node

:::info

Right now 4 cores and 8 GB of RAM should be enough to run a node, but it might increase in the future.
More info in the [FAQ](./faq.mdx).

## From thyra (simplest installation)

If you wish to run a Massa node with a couple of clicks only, you can download thyra app and activate the node-manager
plugin. This will enable you to configure, install, start and even update a node using a simple graphical interface.
For that, there are 5 steps to follow:

1. Install thyra based on your OS:
    - [Windows](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/releases/latest/download/thyra-installer_windows_amd64.exe)
    - MacOS
        - For Apple Silicon CPUs (M1, M2...), use
        [ARM](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/releases/latest/download/thyra-installer_darwin_arm64.tar.gz)
        - For Intel CPUs (i5, i7...), use
        [AMD](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/releases/latest/download/thyra-installer_darwin_amd64.tar.gz)
    - [Linux](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/releases/latest/download/thyra-installer_linux_amd64.tar.gz)
2. Start thyra using the icon tray. If you need help,
[this page](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) can help.
3. [Configure your VPS](https://github.com/massalabs/thyra-node-manager-plugin/wiki) and go to
[Thyra home page](https://my.massa/thyra/home/).
4. Install the node-manager plugin.
5. Add your VPS details and click on "start".
6. You're now a Massa node-runner!

## From binaries (simple installation)

If you just wish to run a Massa node without compiling it yourself, you can simply download the latest binary below and
go the the next step: [Running a node](./run.mdx).

- [Windows executable](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/TEST.22.1/massa_TEST.22.1_release_windows.zip)
- [Linux binary](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/TEST.22.1/massa_TEST.22.1_release_linux.tar.gz) - 
only works with libc2.28 and higher (for example Ubuntu 20.04 and higher)
- [MacOS binary](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/releases/download/TEST.22.1/massa_TEST.22.1_release_macos.tar.gz)

## From source code (advanced installation)

Otherwise, if you wish to run a Massa node from source code, here are the steps to follow:

### On Ubuntu / MacOS

- on Ubuntu, these libs must be installed: ```sudo apt install pkg-config curl git build-essential libssl-dev libclang-dev cmake```
- on MacOS: ```brew install llvm cmake```
- install [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): ```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```
- configure path: ```source $HOME/.cargo/env```
- check rust version: ```rustc --version```
- install nigthly: ```rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-02-27```
- set it as default: ```rustup default nightly-2023-02-27```
- check rust version: ```rustc --version```
- clone this repo: ```git clone --branch testnet https://github.com/massalabs/massa.git```

### On Windows

**Set up your Rust environment**:
- On Windows, you should first follow the indications from Microsoft to be able to run on a Rust environment [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/dev-environment/rust/setup).

- Install Chocolatey and run: ```choco install llvm cmake protoc```
- Install Rust, to be downloaded [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install Git for windows, to be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Install install protoc in your PATH, to be downloaded [here](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases)

**Clone the Massa Git Repository**:
- Open Windows Power Shell
    - Clone the latest distributed version: ```git clone --branch testnet https://github.com/massalabs/massa.git```
    - Change default Rust to nightly: ```rustup default nightly-2023-02-27```
