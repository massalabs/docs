# Creating a Massa wallet

In this tutorial you will learn how to create a Massa wallet.

A wallet is a file that contains a list of keypairs. Like other blockchains, Massa uses elliptic curve cryptography
(specifically ed25519) to secure your coins. It means that your secret key is your password allowing you to spend coins
that were sent to your address.

## From the command line interface

### If your client is not running

Go to the client folder:

```shell
cd massa/massa-client/
```

Start the interactive client and load a wallet file:

```shell
cargo run
```

It will ask your wallet password in order to load the `wallet.dat` file. If the file does not exist, you will be asked
to set a password and it will be created.

### If your client is running

Now you can either generate a new keypair (and associated address):

```shell
wallet_generate_secret_key
```

Or, if you already have one from a previous wallet, you can add manually an existing keypair:

```shell
wallet_add_secret_keys <SecretKey>
```

The list of addresses of your wallet can be accessed with:

```shell
wallet_info
```

Access public key(s) of addresse(s):

```shell
wallet_get_public_key <Address1> <Address2>
```

Access secret key(s) of addresse(s):

```shell
wallet_get_secret_key <Address1> <Address2>
```
