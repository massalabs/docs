# Running a node

## From binaries (simple installation)

Simply run the binaries you downloaded in the previous step:

- Open the massa-node folder and run the massa-node executable
- Open the massa-client folder and run the massa-client executable

### On Ubuntu / MacOS

**Configure the node**

Default configuration is available [here](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/blob/main/massa-node/base_config/config.toml).

You can override the default configuration via massa-node/config/config.toml file.

**Start the node**

On a first window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-node/
```

Launch the node, on Ubuntu:

```shell
./massa-node -p <PASSWORD> |& tee logs.txt
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node You should leave the window opened.

**Start the client**

On a second window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-client/
```

Then:

```shell
./massa-client -p <PASSWORD>
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your client

## From source code (advanced installation)

### On Ubuntu / MacOS

**Start the node**

On a first window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-node/
```

Launch the node, on Ubuntu:

```shell
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD> |& tee logs.txt
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node

Or, on MacOS:

```shell
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD> > logs.txt 2>&1
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node You should leave the window opened.

directories are built before moving to the next step.

### On Windows

:::caution

In case of crash of the Rust compiler or at runtime, please do not report bugs to the rustlang/rust repository, but
[open an issue](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/issues/new/choose) on the Massa repository instead. We will triage
the issues and open them on the Rust side if they are valid. This avoids polluting the main Rust repository with many
reports of the same error.
