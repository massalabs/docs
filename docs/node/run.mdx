# Running a node

This document explains how to run a node.

This assumes that you have installed the node software.
If not, please follow the [installation instructions](/docs/node/install).

## If your node was installed from binaries (simple installation)

Simply run the binaries you downloaded in the previous step:

- Open the massa-node folder and run the massa-node executable
- Open the massa-client folder and run the massa-client executable

### On Ubuntu / MacOS

**Configure the node**

Default configuration is available [here](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/blob/main/massa-node/base_config/config.toml).

You can override the default configuration via massa-node/config/config.toml file.

**Start the node**

In a first window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-node/
```

Launch the node, on Ubuntu:

```shell
./massa-node -p <PASSWORD> |& tee logs.txt
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node You should leave the window opened.

**Start the client**

In a second window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-client/
```

Then:

```shell
./massa-client -p <PASSWORD>
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your client

## If your node was installed from source code (advanced installation)

### On Ubuntu / MacOS

**Start the node**

In a first window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-node/
```

Launch the node, on Ubuntu:

```shell
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD> |& tee logs.txt
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node

Or, on MacOS:

```shell
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD> > logs.txt 2>&1
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password that you will need to keep to restart your node You should leave the window opened.

**Start the client**

On a second window:

```shell
cd massa/massa-client/
```

Then:

```shell
cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD>
```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password. You will need this password to restart your client. Please wait until the
directories are built before moving to the next step.

### On Windows

**Start the Node**

- Open Windows Power Shell or Command Prompt on a first window
    - Type: ```cd massa```
    - Type: ```cd massa-node```
    - Type: ```cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD>```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password. You will need this password to restart your node. You should leave the window
opened.

**Start the Client**

- Open Windows Power Shell or Command Prompt on a second window
    - Type: cd massa
    - Type: cd massa-client
    - Type: ```cargo run --release -- -p <PASSWORD>```

Replace `<PASSWORD>` with a password. You will need this password to restart your client. Please wait until the
directories are built before moving to the next step.

:::caution

In case of crash of the Rust compiler or at runtime, please do not report bugs to the rustlang/rust repository, but
[open an issue](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/issues/new/choose) on the Massa repository instead. We will triage
the issues and open them on the Rust side if they are valid. This avoids polluting the main Rust repository with many
reports of the same error.

## What next ?

Congratulations, you are now running a node.
But your node is still not staking, so it is not producing blocks nor receiving rewards.

It is time to activate staking on your node. Follow the tutorial: [Staking with a node](/docs/node/stake).
