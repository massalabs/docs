# Staking

In Massa, the minimal number of coins required to be able to stake is 100 MAS.
This is the amount necessary to buy one unit of staking rights, which is called one "roll".
The total initial supply is 1B MAS, so in theory, there could be 5 million people staking.

Addresses are randomly selected to stake (create blocks) in all threads, based on the number of rolls they possess.

Rolls can be bought with Massa coins or sold to get the coins back. If you already have more than 100 Massa, you can
continue this tutorial, otherwise, please look into buying some coins first.

## Buying rolls

Get the address that has coins in your wallet. In the Massa client:

```shell
wallet_info
```

Buy rolls with it: put your address, the number of rolls you want to buy, and the operation fee (you can put 0):

```shell
buy_rolls <address> <roll count> <fee>
```

As an example, the command for buying 1 roll with 0 fee for the address
`A12dr48yZaL2NpQkwsrpsNLGDpndFUCVSdYdSiQh4UfkYRMo17km` is: ```buy_rolls
A12dr48yZaL2NpQkwsrpsNLGDpndFUCVSdYdSiQh4UfkYRMo17km 1 0```

It should take less than one minute for your roll to become final, check with:

```shell
wallet_info
```

## Telling your node to start staking with your rolls

Get the address that has rolls in your wallet:

```shell
wallet_info
```

Register your address so that your node start to stake with it:

```shell
node_start_staking <your_address>
```

Now you should wait some time so that your rolls become active: 3 cycles of 128 periods (one period is 32 blocks - 16
sec), so about 1 hour and 40 minutes.

You can check if your rolls are active with the same command:

```shell
wallet_info
```

When your rolls become active, that's it! You're staking!
You should be selected to create blocks in the different threads.

To check when your address is selected to stake, run this command:

```shell
get_addresses <your_address>
```

and look at the "next draws" section.

Also check that your balance increases, for each block or endorsement that you create you should get a small reward.

## Selling rolls

If you want to get back some or all of your coins, sell rolls the same way you bought them:

```shell
sell_rolls <address> <roll count> <fee>
```

It should take some time again for your coins to be credited, and they will be frozen for 1 cycle before you can spend
them, again check with:

```shell
wallet_info
```
