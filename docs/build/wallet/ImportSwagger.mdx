# Import Swagger API in Postman

This guide explains how to import a Swagger API in Postman. This allows you to interact easily with an API defined by a Swagger file.
Here are the steps to follow to get started:

1. **Locate the Swagger File**: Find the latest version of `swagger.yml` [file](https://github.com/massalabs/station/blob/main/api/swagger/server/restapi/resource/swagger.yml) for the API you want to work with and copy its entire content. Alternatively, you can also use your local version of the `swagger.yml` file.

2. **Importing the Swagger**: Launch Postman and navigate to the "APIs" section. From there, click on the "Import" button and select the "Raw text" option. Next, paste the contents of the copied `swagger.yml` file into the designated text field.

3. **Ensure MassaStation is Running**: Start your MassaStation by using the command `task build-run`, or directly from the desktop application if it's already installed on your computer.

4. **Interact with an Endpoint**: Expand the imported API in Postman and select the desired endpoint (e.g., "all Domains Getter"). Replace `{{baseUrl}}` with the correct path (e.g.,for this specific endpoint "all Domains Getter", you can use `station.massa` ) by clicking on the "..." menu, then go to the Variables tab, and add the variable. From there, Click on the "Send" button in Postman to make the API request

Congratulations! You've successfully used Postman with Swagger to interact with an API.
