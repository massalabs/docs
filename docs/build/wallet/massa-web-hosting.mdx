# How to upload a website

Massa Ecosystem allows users to participate, store, and navigate content on the Massa blockchain, among a lot of other things.

This guided is dedicated to getting you started with uploading a website on the blockchain using Massa Station.

Please note that we currently support static websites built with front end technologies like CSS, HTML & ES6 Javascript.

To get started, you need to download Massa Station [here](https://station.massa.net), and if needed follow the installation guide provided at this link: [Massa Station Installation Guide](https://github.com/massalabs/station/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md).

Once Massa Station is installed and launched, please install Massa Wallet using the home and [create an account](https://station.massa/plugin/massa-labs/massa-wallet/web-app/index).

Now that you have an account, you may proceed:

1. Open Massa Station and navigate to: [Massa Station Search Page](https://station.massa/web/search)
2. On the left side of the page, you will find a side panel that contains the steps to upload a website to the Massa blockchain.

   - whole numbers (0-9),
   - lowercase letters (a-z),
   - underscores (\_),
   - dashes (-),
   - between 3 and 50 characters long.
3. Description: A string limited to 280 UTF-8 characters.

With each upload, there are associated costs to storing and hosting the files, you will be able to find more information in the official Massa Labs documentation located here: [Massa Storage Costs](https://docs.massa.net/en/latest/technical-doc/storage-costs.html). It will cost approximately 375 Massa coins for a website of 1.5 Mo.
