# Introduction to Massa Station

One feature of the Massa Blockchain is that you can store and serve web applications directly on chain. Massa Station is the gateway to access web application stored on the Massa blockchain. At its core, the Massa Station desktop application allows you to resolve `.massa` urls (the extension for web application stored and served on Massa). 

But Massa Station is also a meta-application that allows you to create, manage and diffuse plugins that interacts with the Massa blockchain. For example, the [Wallet Plugin](/docs/build/wallet/massa-station.mdx) allows you to manage your assets and interact with Dapps. The [Node Manager Plugin](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-node-manager) allows you to administrate your node.
  
All those plugins are available on the Massa Station's [Plugin Store](https://github.com/massalabs/station-store). 
You can think of the Plugin Store as a packet manager for Massa Station Plugins.
