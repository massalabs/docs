# Creating a plugin: step by step

This tutorial will show you how to create a simple plugin using Go and Swagger. It is possible to use other languages and frameworks such as explained in the [plugin guidelines](./guidelines.mdx).
Here, we will rebuild the [Hello world plugin](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-hello-world/tree/main) from scratch as an example.
Following this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- [Create a basic plugin](./create-basic-plugin.mdx)
- [Add a new endpoint](./create-plugin-with-endpoint.mdx) to your plugin
- [Add a frontend](./create-plugin-with-a-frontend.mdx) to your plugin

But first, let's set up the environment to follow the requirements defined in the [plugin guidelines](./guidelines.mdx).

## Install Go

You can install Go [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Initialize your Go project:

You can create a plugin either in Go and use our tailor-made package or do your own, following the [requirements](./guidelines.mdx).

### Initialize the Go plugin:

- Create and navigate to the folder station-massa-hello-world
- Run:

  ```bash
  go mod init github.com/my-username/station-massa-hello-world
  ```

  :::tip

  You can replace `my-username` with your own username, or the name of your organization. Apply the same logic for the rest of the tutorial.

#### Create a Logo

- Create the folders `web/content` and add `hello_world.svg` in it.
- Add your custom logo or copy-paste [this one](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-hello-world/blob/main/web/content/hello_world.svg?short_path=1cd8e84):

#### Add a manifest file

- Create `manifest.json` in the root of your project.
- Paste the following content, replacing the values with your own:

```json
{
  "author": "My Name",
  "name": "station-massa-hello-world",
  "description": "hello world plugin",
  "logo": "hello_world.svg",
  "home": "",
  "version": "0.0.6",
  "apispec": ""
}
```

You're now ready to start building your plugin!
