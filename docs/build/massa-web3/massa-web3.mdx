# Leveraging Javascript API for Massa interaction

## What is Massa-Web3?

Massa-web3 is an exhaustive library enabling interaction with the Massa blockchain. It is viable both in a browser environment and Node.js runtime.

:::note
Massa-web3 operates by utilizing JsonRPC API in the background to facilitate blockchain communication. The API is divided into a Private and a Public segment, used for node management and blockchain interactions, respectively. For more information on the API, please refer to the [JsonRPC API documentation](api/jsonrpc).
:::

By using massa-web3 methods available, you will be able to interact with the Massa blockchain in a variety of ways:

- Send transactions
- Deploy smart contracts
- Get account information
- Add an IP address to the whitelist of your node
- Buy and sell rolls
- Fetch events from the blockchain
- And much more!

In addition, the library includes a collection of handy utility functions (e.g. to convert between different units of MASSA, etc.).
:::tip

## Installation

Massa-web3 could be used as a library for frameworks or as a stand-alone bundled js file which can be easily loaded into the browser.

#### Requirements

    -   NodeJS 14+
    -   npm / yarn (see package.json)

#### Library (Node.js/React/Vue.js) usage

Just install the library using npm:

```shell
npm install @massalabs/massa-web3
```

#### Browser usage

If you want to use the library in a vanilla javascript project, please add the following script tag to your html file:

```html
<script
  type="text/javascript"
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@massalabs/massa-web3@x.x.x/bundle.js"
></script>
```

whereby the x.x.x is one of the available released versions under [Massa-web3's releases page](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3/releases):

In your code, once the script is fully loaded, just use window.massa to access all massa-web3 exports.

```ts
<script>console.log("Massa Web3 ", window.massa);</script>
```

## Usage

### Initialization

There are two types of client initialization. The first one is connecting to Massa's public rpc node using a so-called default client. Please note that specifying a base account is only optional at this point. The code below illustrates how to do that:

```ts
import {
  ClientFactory,
  Client,
  DefaultProviderUrls,
  IAccount,
} from "@massalabs/massa-web3";

// create a base account for signing transactions
const baseAccount = {
  address: "AU12PWTzCKkkE9P5Supt3Fkb4QVZ3cdfB281TGaup7Nv1DY12a6F1",
  secretKey: "S12tw4YShWtjWfy7YBQ9Erbcg6DYgWnMgb5hGjn9hAKGtgrLNa7L",
  publicKey: "P1hG8zRRJF2v3qkwyZ2fnHJeaVw9uT4huCkwcWJVvgypEz6D2aR",
} as IAccount;

// initialize a testnet client
const testnetClient: Client = await ClientFactory.createDefaultClient(
  DefaultProviderUrls.TESTNET,
  true,
  baseAccount
);
```

The second way is to create a custom client connecting to a node whose ip and ports are to be specified by the user.

```ts
import {
  ClientFactory,
  Client,
  IAccount,
  IProvider,
  ProviderType,
} from "@massalabs/massa-web3";

// create a base account for signing transactions
const baseAccount = {
  address: "AU12PWTzCKkkE9P5Supt3Fkb4QVZ3cdfB281TGaup7Nv1DY12a6F1",
  secretKey: "S12tw4YShWtjWfy7YBQ9Erbcg6DYgWnMgb5hGjn9hAKGtgrLNa7L",
  publicKey: "P1hG8zRRJF2v3qkwyZ2fnHJeaVw9uT4huCkwcWJVvgypEz6D2aR",
} as IAccount;

// initialize a custom client using an own provider
const providers: Array<IProvider> = [
  {
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:33035",
    type: ProviderType.PUBLIC,
  } as IProvider,
  {
    url: "http://127.0.0.1:33034",
    type: ProviderType.PRIVATE,
  } as IProvider,
];

const customClient: Client = await ClientFactory.createCustomClient(
  providers,
  true,
  baseAccount
);
```

Please note that connecting to a locally running node could be easily done using the factory method:

```ts
const testnetClient: Client = await ClientFactory.createDefaultClient(
  DefaultProviderUrls.LOCALNET,
  true,
  baseAccount
);
```

Once there is an initialized client instance, it is straightforward to call methods on it:

```ts
import { IStatus, IAddressInfo } from "@massalabs/massa-web3";

const addressesResp: Array<IAddressInfo> = await web3Client
  .publicApi()
  .getAddresses(["some_address"]);
```

### Client exposed APIs

The client exposes several APIs which could be used on its own (also initialized as stand-alone) if one needs to:

```ts
web3Client.publicApi()          -> sub-client for public api                    (interface: PublicApiClient)
web3Client.privateApi()         -> sub-client for private api                   (interface: PrivateApiClient)
web3Client.wallet()             -> sub-client for wallet-related operations     (interface: WalletClient)
web3Client.smartContracts()     -> sub-client for smart contracts interaction   (interface: SmartContractsClient)
```

You can find details for each of the above sub-clients in the following sections.

- [Private API](massa-web3/massa-web3-private-api)
- [Wallet Operations](massa-web3/massa-web3-wallet)
