Here are some examples of how to use the Massa Web3 API for dApp development.

## Calling a smart contract

Full code of the Age dApp is available [here](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/tree/main/age).

The [age smart contract](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/blob/main/age/contracts/assembly/contracts/main.ts) stores the name and age of persons.
This snippets shows how to call the smart contract and change the age value of Alice.

After creating a react app and setting up the Massa Web3 API as described in the
[installation](/docs/build/massa-web3#installation) section, we can call the smart contract method `changeAge` like this:

```typescript
let args = new Args().addString(inputName).addU32(newAge);
let opId = await client.smartContracts().callSmartContract({
  targetAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  targetFunction: "changeAge",
  parameter: args.serialize(),
  maxGas: BigInt(1000000),
  coins: BigInt(0),
  fee: BigInt(0),
});
```

Since that method requires a string and an integer as parameters, we need to serialize them first. The `Args` class
provides a convenient way to do that. You can learn more about Args via the [source code](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3/blob/3dbfe0e60fb397af4c4502ea0031ee5ae1f2aba6/packages/web3-utils/src/arguments.ts#L68)
and its usage with the [examples](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/).

## Reading a smart contract value

You can directly read smart contract datastore values
with the `readSmartContractData` method, which does not require any gas or fee:

```typescript
const res = await client.smartContracts().readSmartContract({
  maxGas: BigInt(1000000),
  targetAddress: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  targetFunction: "getAge",
  parameter: new Args().addString(inputName).serialize(),
});

const age = res.returnValue;
```

:::info
Since the `getAge` method doesn't change the state of the smart contract, we don't need to use a client with an account linked to it.
