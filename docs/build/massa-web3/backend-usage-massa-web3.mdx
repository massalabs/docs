If you need to interact with the Massa network for your backend, you can use the Massa Web3 API without the wallet provider. Therefore
you will need to write your secret key directly in your code. Initialization of the client is shown in the [introduction](/docs/build/massa-web3#without-wallet-provider)
of the Massa Web3.

messages, etc.

A [complete example](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-web3/blob/main/examples/wallet/index.ts) of how to use the Wallet
