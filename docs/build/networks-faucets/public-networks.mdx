## What's a Network, Anyway?

In the realm of blockchain technology, a network is a decentralized system of interconnected nodes.
These nodes work in harmony to ensure the blockchain runs smoothly, validating transactions, adding them to the blockchain, and maintaining the integrity of the ledger.

## What about Faucets?

A faucet, in the context of blockchain, is a mechanism that provides small amounts of cryptocurrency to users for free.
Think of it as a digital tap that drips a small portion of a specific cryptocurrency.

Faucets play a crucial role in the blockchain ecosystem:

- they offer a friendly introduction to new users by giving them a starting amount of cryptocurrency, and
- they also aid developers in testing and building blockchain applications by providing the necessary tokens for experimentation.

## What's Special About These Networks?

### Securnet

The Massa Securnet serves as a security playground in the Massa ecosystem.

The network is deployed with the following public bootstrap servers:
- 149.202.86.103
- 149.202.89.125
- 158.69.120.215
- 158.69.23.120
- 198.27.74.5
- 51.75.60.228

The full configuration of the network is accessible in the [config.toml file](https://github.com/massalabs/massa/blob/securnet/massa-node/base_config/config.toml) on GitHub

A Bug Bounty program lets anyone try and find security holes, of different types. Securnet allows anyone to run a node and actively participate in the network,
trying to break things related to:

- [The node](https://github.com/massalabs/massa)
- [Massa standards](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-standards)
- [Massa Station wallet](/docs/massaStation/home)

More information about the Bug Bounty will be available soon.

### Buildnet

The Massa Buildnet serves as your reliable playground for crafting and deploying smart contracts on the Massa blockchain.

While we regularly push new, groundbreaking features to Securnet, Buildnet follows a more gradual upgrade cycle. This careful pace ensures its constant availability and stability - key factors that you, as a developer, rely on.

At MassaLabs, we put significant effort into the careful maintenance of Buildnet. Our goal is to provide you with a platform where you can build robust, innovative applications.

Leveraging Buildnet's unique features and capabilities, you can navigate the forefront of blockchain technology with confidence and peace of mind, knowing you have a stable and dependable environment for your projects.

## Are There Any Requirements for Using Faucets?

Sure! You'll need:

- A Massa wallet (Don't have one yet? Generate addresses on the [Explorer website](https://massa.net/testnet/wallet))
- A [Discord account](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started)

## Library Compatibility with Massa Networks

The following table outlines library compatibility across the Massa networks. Use this as a guide to select the appropriate library based on the network you're working with and your project needs.
