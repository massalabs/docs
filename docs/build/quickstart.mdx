# Build your first decentralized application

Welcome to the quickstart guide to building your first decentralized application (dApp) on the Massa blockchain. This guide will walk you through the process of developing a simple "Hello World" dApp using a smart contract written in AssemblyScript and a basic frontend using either HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or React.

## Overview

The application we're building is straightforward - a user can retrieve a greeting message set during the deployment of the dApp. This greeting message is stored on the blockchain and is permanently visible to all users of the dApp.

- **Smart Contract (SC)**

Our smart contract, written in AssemblyScript, will form the backbone of our dApp. It will store a single greeting message that users can read.

- **Frontend**

This simple web interface, built with either vanilla JavaScript or React, will allow users to read the greeting message set during the deployment. It will interact with the Massa blockchain and read data from our smart contract.

## Smart Contract

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm installed**

We recommend using Node.js version 18 or later, and the compatible npm version. You can download and install Node.js and npm from the official website: https://nodejs.org/.

- **Massa wallet with coins on it**

Before deploying your smart contract to the Massa blockchain, you need to have a funded Massa wallet. Check our guide on creating and funding a Massa wallet here (TODO: link to be added).

- **The secret key of your wallet**

To deploy your smart contract, you will need your wallet's secret key. Follow this tutorial (TODO: link to be added) to retrieve your wallet information.

### Setting up your project

Follow these steps to set up your smart contract project:

- **Step 1 Initialize Your Smart Contract Project**

Open a terminal, navigate to your preferred directory, and run the following command to create your project:

```bash
npx @massalabs/sc-project-initializer init massa-hello-world
```

This command creates a new folder named massa-hello-world containing all the necessary files for developing a Massa smart contract.

:::info
**assembly**: This directory is where your smart contract code lives. It includes your smart contract files in the **contracts** subdirectory and the test files in the **tests** subdirectory.

**src**: This directory contains your deployment script file, deploy.ts, which deploys your smart contract to the Massa blockchain.

**.env.example**: This file is an example of the .env file that you will need to create. It contains the environment variables that you will need to set in order to deploy your smart contract.
:::

- **Step 2: Create a .env at the root**

Create a .env file at the root of your project directory and define the following environment variables:

- **`WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`**: Store your wallet's private key used to deploy the contract here. Ensure your wallet is funded.
- **`JSON_RPC_URL_PUBLIC`**: This is the URL of the JSON-RPC interface of a public or a private Massa node.

```
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="Your_private_key_here"

JSON_RPC_URL_PUBLIC=https://buildnet.massa.net/api/v2:33035
```

### Writing and Deploying the smart contract

Our smart contract will allow users to set and get a greeting message. Replace the content of the main.ts file in assembly/contracts with the following code:

```tsx
import { Args, stringToBytes } from "@massalabs/as-types";
import {
  callerHasWriteAccess,
  generateEvent,
  Storage,
  Context,
} from "@massalabs/massa-as-sdk";

/**
 * This function is meant to be called only one time: when the contract is deployed.
 *
 * @param _ - not used
 */
export function constructor(_: StaticArray<u8>): StaticArray<u8> {
  // This line is important. It ensures that this function can't be called in the future.
  // If you remove this check, someone could call your constructor function and reset your smart contract.
  if (!Context.isDeployingContract()) {
    return [];
  }

  Storage.set("greeting", "Hello, world!");

  generateEvent(`Greeting has been set`);

  return [];
}

/**
 * Get the current greeting message.
 *
 * @param _ - not used
 *
 * @returns empty array
 *
 * @throws if greeting is not set
 */
export function getGreeting(_: StaticArray<u8>): StaticArray<u8> {
  const greeting = Storage.get("greeting");

  generateEvent(`Greeting has been read ${greeting}`);

  return stringToBytes(greeting);
}
```

To deploy your smart contract, follow these steps:

- **Step 1: Compile Your Smart Contract**

In your project directory, run the following command to compile your smart contract into a WebAssembly (Wasm) file:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles your **`helloWorld.ts`** contract into a **`helloWorld.wasm`** file and optimizes it for size.

- **Step 2: Deploy the smart contract**

With your smart contract compiled and ready, you can now deploy it to the Massa blockchain. To do this, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Upon successful execution, the console should display information about the transaction.
