# Build your first decentralized application

In this guide, we're going to build a simple "Hello world" decentralized application (dApp) on the Massa blockchain. This application will contain a smart contract written in AssemblyScript and a basic frontend using html, css, javascript or React, based on your preference.

## **The Application Overview**

Our application will be straightforward - a user can change a greeting message stored on the blockchain, and any changes will be permanent and visible to all users of the dApp.

- **Smart Contract (SC)**

The smart contract is the backbone of our application. It is a contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. We will use AssemblyScript to write our smart contract. This contract will hold a single greeting message that can be updated and read.

- **Frontend**

The frontend of our dApp will be a simple web interface built using vanilla JavaScript or React. This interface will allow users to read the current greeting message and update it. It will communicate with the Massa blockchain, read data from our smart contract, and trigger smart contract methods based on user input.
