# Build your first decentralized application

In this guide, we're going to build a simple "Hello world" decentralized application (dApp) on the Massa blockchain. This application will contain a smart contract written in AssemblyScript and a basic frontend using html, css, javascript or React, based on your preference.

## **The Application Overview**

Our application will be straightforward - a user can change a greeting message stored on the blockchain, and any changes will be permanent and visible to all users of the dApp.

- **Smart Contract (SC)**

The smart contract is the backbone of our application. It is a contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. We will use AssemblyScript to write our smart contract. This contract will hold a single greeting message that can be updated and read.

- **Frontend**

The frontend of our dApp will be a simple web interface built using vanilla JavaScript or React. This interface will allow users to read the current greeting message and update it. It will communicate with the Massa blockchain, read data from our smart contract, and trigger smart contract methods based on user input.

## **Smart Contract**

### **Prerequisites**

- **Node.js and npm installed** TODO specify version of node

  Before you can begin developing your dApp, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. You can download and install Node.js and npm from the official website: \*\*[https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)\*\*

- **Massa wallet with coins on it**

  Before you can deploy your smart contract to the Massa blockchain, you need to have a Massa wallet with coins on it. To do this you can check this page ... TODO: Create get coins page

- **The secret key of your wallet**

  To deploy your smart contract you will need the secret key of your wallet. You can find it following this tutoriel. TODO: Create tutorial to retrieve wallet information

### Setting up your project

The first step in building your decentralized application (dApp) is to set up your development environment by initializing your smart contract project.

- **Step 1 Initialize Your Smart Contract Project**

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project in the terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx @massalabs/sc-project-initializer init massa-hello-world
```

After running this command, you should see a new folder named **`massa-hello-world`** (or whatever name you chose for your project) in your directory. This folder is your smart contract project, and it should contain all the necessary files for developing a Massa smart contract:

Now you have a smart contract project initialized and ready to go.

:::info
**assembly**: This directory is where your smart contract code lives. It includes your smart contract files in the **contracts** subdirectory and the test files in the **tests** subdirectory.

**src**: This directory contains your deployment script file, deploy.ts, which deploys your smart contract to the Massa blockchain.

**.env.example**: This file is an example of the .env file that you will need to create. It contains the environment variables that you will need to set in order to deploy your smart contract.
:::

- **Step 2: Create a .env at the root**

In your **`.env`** file, you will define two environment variables: **`WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`** and **`JSON_RPC_URL_PUBLIC`**. Let's go through each of them:

- **`WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`**: This environment variable is intended to store your wallet's private key that will be used to deploy the contract. Make sure you have coins on this address
- **`JSON_RPC_URL_PUBLIC`**: This is the URL of the JSON-RPC interface of a public or a private Massa node.

```
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY="Your_private_key_here"

JSON_RPC_URL_PUBLIC=https://buildnet.massa.net/api/v2:33035
```

### Writing the smart contract

Let's proceed with writing a basic smart contract. This smart contract will allow users to set and get a greeting message.

Replace the content of the main.ts file in assembly/contracts by the following code:

```tsx
import { Args, stringToBytes } from "@massalabs/as-types";
import {
  callerHasWriteAccess,
  generateEvent,
  Storage,
  Context,
} from "@massalabs/massa-as-sdk";

/**
 * This function is meant to be called only one time: when the contract is deployed.
 *
 * @param _ - not used
 */
export function constructor(_: StaticArray<u8>): StaticArray<u8> {
  // This line is important. It ensures that this function can't be called in the future.
  // If you remove this check, someone could call your constructor function and reset your smart contract.
  if (!Context.isDeployingContract()) {
    return [];
  }

  Storage.set("greeting", "Hello, world!");

  generateEvent(`Greeting has been set`);

  return [];
}

/**
 * Get the current greeting message.
 *
 * @param _ - not used
 *
 * @returns empty array
 *
 * @throws if greeting is not set
 */
export function getGreeting(_: StaticArray<u8>): StaticArray<u8> {
  const greeting = Storage.get("greeting");

  generateEvent(`Greeting has been read ${greeting}`);

  return stringToBytes(greeting);
}
```

### Deploying the smart contract

Deploying your smart contract to the Massa blockchain involves several steps. Your assemblyscript file will need to be compile into a WebAssembly module, create a deployment transaction, and then send that transaction to the blockchain. Let's go through the process:

- **Step 1: Compile Your Smart Contract**

Before you can deploy your contract, you need to compile it into WebAssembly (Wasm) format. This can be done using the AssemblyScript compiler.

In the project directory, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles your **`helloWorld.ts`** contract into a **`helloWorld.wasm`** file and optimizes it for size.

- **Step 2: Deploy the smart contract**

Now that you have a deployment script, you can deploy your smart contract to the Massa blockchain. In the project directory, run the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

In you console you should see all the information about the transaction. You can also check the transaction on the explorer.
