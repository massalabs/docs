# Autonomous Smart Contracts: Guaranteed Execution

## Introduction

Massa is developing an exciting new feature for Autonomous Smart Contracts (ASCs) called Guaranteed Execution. This feature aims to enhance the reliability and predictability of smart contract operations on the Massa blockchain.

## Concept Overview

Guaranteed Execution introduces a mechanism for smart contracts to reserve future execution slots, ensuring that critical operations occur at specified times, regardless of network conditions.

### Key Aspects

1. **Future Slot Reservation**: Smart contracts can book specific future time slots for execution.
2. **Execution Assurance**: Once reserved, the execution is guaranteed to occur at the specified time.
3. **Resource Management**: The system allocates computational resources for these guaranteed executions.
4. **Advance Planning**: Allows for scheduling executions further into the future with certainty.

## Advantages Over Current System

Guaranteed Execution addresses limitations in the current ASC system:

- **Predictability**: Eliminates uncertainty about whether a transaction will be processed in high-congestion periods.
- **Timeliness**: Ensures critical operations occur exactly when

## Conclusion

Guaranteed Execution is a significant step forward in the evolution of Autonomous Smart Contracts. This feature will provide developers with a powerful tool for building robust, reliable, and predictable smart contract systems. Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting development!
