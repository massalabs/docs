# Autonomous Smart Contracts: Introduction

Autonomous Smart Contracts (ASCs) represent a revolutionary concept in blockchain technology, enabling smart contracts to operate independently without the need of external triggers. This capability is a cornerstone feature of the Massa blockchain, setting it apart from traditional blockchain platforms.

## Key Features

1. **Self-Execution**: ASCs can schedule their own future executions.
2. **Inter-Contract Communication**: ASCs can trigger functions in other contracts.
3. **Conditional Execution**: Executions can be based on specific blockchain conditions.

## Looking Ahead

In the following sections, we'll explore how to implement Autonomous Smart Contracts using Massa's `sendMessage` function and discuss the upcoming feature of guaranteed execution for even more reliable autonomous operations.

Stay tuned to learn how you can leverage these powerful capabilities in your Massa blockchain projects!
