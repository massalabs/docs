# Prerequisites

Before you can begin developing smart contracts on the Massa blockchain, you'll need to ensure that your development environment meets the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system.


:::tip
We recommend updating Node.js and npm to the latest version for best performance and security.

To update npm, run the following commands:
```shell
npm install -g npm
```

To update Node.js, the recommended way is to use `n`, the Node.js version manager.
If you do not already have `n` installed, you can install it with the following command:
```shell
npm install -g n
```
Once `n` is installed, you can update to the latest version of Node.js with the following command:
```shell
n latest
```

Once you have an up-to-date Node.js, you're ready to start developing smart contracts on the Massa blockchain.
