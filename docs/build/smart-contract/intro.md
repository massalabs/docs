# Introduction

Smart contracts are programs that can interact with the blockchain, which can be viewed as a *decentralized database*. They allow developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) with controlled execution of contractual terms, where **code is law**.

## But Technically, What is a Smart Contract?

Smart contracts are human-readable code that can be compiled and deployed on a blockchain. In this context, a smart contract can be seen as a *stored procedure* that can modify the data, interact with other smart contracts, and can be called by end users.

Thanks to the **asynchronous execution of smart contracts**, they can even automatically wake up at a specific time or when the ledger reaches a specific condition, such as the data of a smart contract having a specific value.

## Limitations of Smart Contracts

While smart contracts have many benefits, they also have limitations.

For example, smart contracts:

- Are small, and storage has a cost.
- Have short execution times, and execution has a cost, often called gas, and there is a gas limit for a given slot.
- Must be deterministic, which implies that all their parameters are public and they can only access information on the blockchain.
