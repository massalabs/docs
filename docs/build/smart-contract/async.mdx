# Autonomous smart contracts (ASC)

Autonomous smart contracts (ASC) are a set of features that allow smart contracts to be executed asynchronously.
It allow a smart contract to be scheduled in the future in a decentralized way.
These features enable developers to build more complex and powerful decentralized applications on the Massa blockchain.

Two different types of ASC are available in Massa:
- [Async calls](/docs/learn/asc/massa-asc#async-messages-allowing-smart-contracts-to-emit-operation-like-messages)
- [Deferred calls](/docs/learn/asc/massa-asc#deferred-calls-scheduling-future-calls-with-guaranteed-execution)

The main difference between them is the guarantee of execution. Deferred calls are guaranteed while async messages are not.
In both cases, a smart contract function will be called and executed if conditions are met.
An ASC call follow the same execution parameters as a regular smart contract call (including coins, maxGas, fee and function arguments).

## Async Call overview

The [asyncCall](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk/blob/main/assembly/std/contract/calls.ts#L204) function enables scheduling an operation for execution at a future time. The operation is processed as soon as possible after the specified start slot but no later than the end slot.

### Execution Behavior:
- Operations are executed deterministically on all nodes.
- Execution follows a priority system based on the fee attached to the message.
- If an async operation has a low fee/maxGas ratio, it may be delayed if higher-fee async operation take priority.
- If all slots in the specified period are congested with higher-fee async operations, it may never execute.

### Optional Execution Filter:
You can add a filter condition that requires a state update before the operation executes. Instead of executing "as soon as possible within the range", the operation will execute only after a specific state change occurs.

### Filter Parameters:
- filterAddress: The contract or account whose state change will trigger execution.
- filterKey: A specific datastore entry within filterAddress that must change. filterAddress must be provided.

### Execution Conditions:
- If only filterAddress is provided:
   - The message executes within the specified range only if there is a state change (e.g., balance update) in filterAddress.
- If filterKey is also provided:
   - The message executes within the range only if the specific filterKey in filterAddress's datastore has changed.

```typescript
asyncCall(
  at: Address,
  functionName: string,
  validityStartSlot: Slot,
  validityEndSlot: Slot,
  maxGas: u64,
  fee: u64,
  functionParams: StaticArray<u8> = [],
  coins: u64 = 0,
  filterAddress: Address = new Address(),
  filterKey: StaticArray<u8> = [],
  ): void
```

Parameters:
   - `at`: Address of the contract to call.
   - `functionName`: Function to call in the contract.
   - `validityStartSlot`: Validity start slot.
   - `validityEndSlot`: Validity end slot.
   - `maxGas`: Maximum gas to spend for the execution.
   - `fee`: Fee to be paid for message execution.
   - `functionParams`: Serialized function call parameters.
   - `coins`: Coins to allocate for the execution. If called function is on the same contract, this field has no effect as sender and recipient are the same.
   - `filterAddress`: Address trigger filter.
   - `filterKey`: Datastore key filter from the trigger address.

### Usage example

Syntra leverage the async call feature to allow sending tips or setup vesting plans for users.
Check [Syntra smart contract](https://github.com/massalabs/syntra/blob/main/smart-contract/assembly/internal.ts#L76) for a real world example of async call usage.

## Deferred calls

Unlike async calls, deferred calls are guaranteed to be executed at a given slot.
The scheduele mecanism works as a booking market based on computation needs and load of available slots.
In order to book for an execution in the future, a user must pay a fee to the network.
The booking quote is calculated based on the amount of computation needed, the size of function call parameters in bytes and the load of the network.

### Request a quote

The [deferredCallQuote](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk/blob/main/assembly/std/deferredCalls.ts#L17) function is used to get the booking fee for a deferred call. The quote provides an estimate of the fee required to schedule the deferred call for the given slot.

```typescript
deferredCallQuote(
  targetSlot: Slot,
  maxGas: u64,
  paramsSize: u64 = 0,
): u64
```

Parameters:
   - `targetSlot`: Slot to book for the execution.
   - `maxGas`: The maximum amount of gas that the deferred call can use.
   - `paramsSize`: Serialized function call parameters size in bytes.

Returns:
   - The booking quote in nanoMAS for the deferred call.

### Register a deferred call

The [deferredCallRegister](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk/blob/main/assembly/std/deferredCalls.ts#L42) function is used to book a deferred call.

```typescript
deferredCallRegister(
  targetAddress: string,
  targetFunction: string,
  targetSlot: Slot,
  maxGas: u64,
  params: StaticArray<u8> = [],
  coins: u64 = 0,
): string
```

Parameters:
   - `targetAddress`: Address of the contract to call.
   - `targetFunction`: Function to call in the contract.
   - `targetSlot`: Slot to book for the execution.
   - `maxGas`: The maximum amount of gas that the deferred call can use.
   - `params`: Serialized function call parameters.
   - `coins`: Coins to allocate for the execution. If called function is on the same contract, this field has no effect as sender and recipient are the same.

Returns:
   - The created deferred call ID.

### Cancel a deferred call

The [deferredCallCancel](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk/blob/main/assembly/std/deferredCalls.ts#L79) function is used to cancel a deferred call.
A deferred call can only be canceled by its creator.
To avoid booking market manipulation, the booking fee is not refunded and reserved gas for execution is not freed when canceling.

```typescript
deferredCallCancel(id: string): void
```

Parameters:
   - `id`: The deferred call ID to cancel.

### Check deferred call status

The [deferredCallExists](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk/blob/main/assembly/std/deferredCalls.ts#L68) function is used to check if a deferred call is schedueled.

```typescript
deferredCallExists(id: string): bool
```

Parameters:
   - `id`: The deferred call ID to check.

Returns:
   - True if the deferred call is schedueled. False if already executed, canceled or inexistant.

### Find a slot to book

The [findCheapestSlot](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-as-sdk/blob/main/assembly/std/deferredCalls.ts#L92) function is a helper that compares the booking quotes in a given slot range and returns the cheapest one.

```typescript
findCheapestSlot(
  startPeriod: u64,
  endPeriod: u64,
  maxGas: u64,
  paramsSize: u64,
): Slot
```

Parameters:
   - `startPeriod`: First slot to check.
   - `endPeriod`: Last slot to check.
   - `maxGas`: The maximum amount of gas that the deferred call can use.
   - `paramsSize`: Serialized function call parameters size in bytes.

Returns:
   - The slot with the cheapest quote in the given range.

### Usage example

Deferred call manager is a smart contract example that allow to schedule tasks in the future and monitor execuions.
